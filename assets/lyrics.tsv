8956	It is Well with My Soul	Horacio Spafford	N/A	N/A		When peace, like a river, attendeth my way. When sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul. It is well with my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul. Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come. Let this blest assurance control that Christ hath regarded my helpless estate and hath shed His own blood for my soul. My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! My sin, not in part but the whole, is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live. If Jordan above me shall roll, no pang shall be mine, for in death as in life thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul. But, Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait. The sky, not the grave, is our goal. Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord! Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul! And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight, the clouds be rolled back as a scroll. The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend. Even so, it is well with my soul.	9
9161	It Had to Be You	Harry Connick Jr.	Rachael & Adam			It had to be you. It had to be you. I wandered around and finally found the somebody who could make me be true. Could make me be blue or even be glad just to be sad just thinking of you. Some others I've seen might never be mean, might never be cross or try to be boss. But they wouldn't do for nobody else gave me a thrill. With all your faults I love you still, it had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you. Some others I've seen might never be mean, might never be cross or try to be boss. But they wouldn't do for nobody else gave me a thrill. With all your faults I love you still. Baby, it had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you.	11
	From This Moment On	Shania Twain				I do swear that I'll always be there. I'd give anything and everything, and I will always care. Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow, for better, for worse, I will love you with every beat of my heart. From this moment, life has begun. From this moment, you are the one. Right beside you is where I belong, from this moment on. From this moment, I have been blessed. I live only for your happiness. And for your love I'd give my last breath, from this moment on. I give my hand to you with all my heart. I can't wait to live my life with you, I can't wait to start. You and I will never be apart. My dreams came true because of you. From this moment, as long as I live, I will love you, I promise you this. There is nothing I wouldn't give, from this moment on. You're the reason I believe in love.

	Everything I Do, I Do It For You	Bryan Adams				Look into my eyes you will see what, you mean to me. Search your heart, search your soul, and when you find me there, you'll search no more.

If you could see what I see? You're created to be the perfect one for me. If you could see what I see? If beauty is all in the eye of the beholder then I am beholding true beauty.	9

Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight. I have come so far to find you, so far to find you. Will you take my love and give up the fight, I have come so far to find you. So far to find you. From a world away, I journeyed just to hold your hand. You will never be alone again, I've come so far to find you, so far to find you. You were fighting and fearful, you were hiding your heart away. But I was trying so hard to show you 'cause there were no words that I could say. If you could see my heart, you would know that all I want to do is care for you. Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight? I have come so far to find you, so far to find you. Will you take my love and give up the fight? I have come so far to find you, so far to find you?

9041	U Got It Bad	Usher	Bruce & Tammie	06.05.06		When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who makes you change your ways.

You got it bad when you say that you love 'em and you really know everything that used to matter, it don't matter no more. Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all), flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm). Said I'm fortunate to have you girl, I want you to know, I really adore you. All my people that know what's going on, look at your mate, help me sing my song. Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl, I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world. Ladies say I'm your girl, you're my man, promise to love you the best I can. See I've been there, done it, fucked around. After all that, this is what I found: Everyone of y'all are just like me.

9195	Make It Sweet	Old Dominion	David & Donna	01.14.20		I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind, I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block. I know you get tired, I know you get down, I know you get sick of this soul sucking town but let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got. 'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me. I never gotta wonder where my honey be. I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night, seven days a week I got an appetite. The sunsets like a tangerine. Let's find a road we've never seen. Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me. Life is short, make it sweet. Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7, let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair and let that windshield frame the ocean, radio keep coast-to-coastin'. If we don't get where we're going, baby I don't care, I'm already there. 'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me. I never gotta wonder where my honey be. I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night, seven days a week I got an appetite. The sunsets like a tangerine. Let's find a road we've never seen.

I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night, seven days a week I got an appetite. The sunsets like a tangerine. Let's find a road we've never seen. Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me. Life is short, make it sweet. Life is short, make it sweet. Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah.	7
9192	The Two of Us	The Beatles	Jim & Karen	04.23.09		Two of us riding nowhere spending someone's hard earned pay. Two of us Sunday driving, not arriving on our way back home. We're on our way home. We're on our way home. We're going home. Two of us sending postcards, writing letters on my wall. You and me burning matches, lifting latches on our way back home. We're on our way home, we're on our way home, we're going home. You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead. Two of us wearing raincoats standing so low in the sun. You and me chasing paper getting nowhere on our way back home. We're on our way home, we're on our way home, we're going home.	11
9182	Follow Me	John Denver	John & Cindy	09.03.93		It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done, to be so in love with you and so alone. Follow me where I go what I do and who I know. Make it part of you to be a part of me. Follow me up and down all the way and all around. Take my hand and say you'll follow me. It's long been on my mind, you know it's been a long, long time. I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand the way I feel about you and just how much I need you to be there where I can talk to you when there's no one else around. Follow me where I go what I do and who I know. Make it part of you to be a part of me. Follow me up and down all the way and all around. Take my hand and say you'll follow me. You see I'd like to share my life with you and show you things I've seen, places that I'm going to, places where I've been. To have you there beside me and never be alone and all the time that you're with me we will be at home. Follow me where I go, what I do, and who I know.

9175	Fallen Embers	Enya	Leroy & Nicola	05.31.03		Once, as my heart remembers, all the stars were fallen embers. Once, when night seemed forever, I was with you. Once, in the care of morning, in the air was all belonging. Once, when that day was dawning, I was with you. How far we are from morning, how far we are and the stars shining through the darkness, falling in the air. Once, as the night was leaving into us our dreams were weaving. Once, all dreams were worth keeping, I was with you. Once, when our hearts were singing, I was with you.	13

Tonight you told me that you ache for somethin' new 'cause some other woman is lookin' like something that might be good for you. Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone. Go on believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong. But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you and I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you. It's only fear that makes you run the demons that you're hiding from. When all your promises are gone I'm the only one. Please baby can't you see I'm trying to explain. I've been here before and I'm locking the door and I'm not going back again. Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away.

9246	Reasons for Waiting	Jethro Tull				What a sight for my eyes to see you in sleep. Could it stop the sun rise hearing you weep? You're not seen, you're not heard but I stand by my word. Came a thousand miles just to catch you while you're smiling. What a day for laughter and walking at night. Me following after, your hand holding tight.

9302	When I First Kissed You	Extreme	Mario & Anna	10.25.97		New york city can be so pretty from a bird's eye view. Because up there, yeah, that's where I first kissed you. A modern day romance, a perfect performance. Acting like two fools saying silly things, whisper sweet nothings, live young lovers only do. I was shaking, you were breathtaking like the empire state.

9309	It Takes a Woman	Blackhawk	Robert & Melanie	10.13.01		It takes a dreamer to get this far from my hometown, a real believer to look up when things are down.  It takes a fool to let a good life fall apart ut, when a man knows something's missing in his heart. It takes a woman, it takes forever to get beyond the bitter years and if I ever, if I ever get that far from here, I can look back, and say that I survived. But for a man to really make it in this life it takes a woman. You can gain the world or lose your soul but if you don't have someone to hold, you can't feel the victory for defeat. Climb higher than you've ever gone when you reach the top, you're still alone. Flying high don't make a man complete, it takes a woman. Any fool can let a good life fall apart but foolish pride can't fill an empty heart, it takes a woman.	12

9383	Take it to the Limit	The Eagles	Derek & Penny			All alone at the end of the evening and the bright lights have faded to blue. I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me, I never knew.

Only a fiver to our name, the drunk on the doorstep had more to our shame. Living over the office had its trials.

9277	Make someone happy	Jimmy Durante	Michael & Jennifer	07.27.96		It's so important to make someone happy, make just one someone happy. Make just one heart the heart you sing to.

9290	Because the night	Patti Smith Group	Steve & Amanda	09.08.12		Take me now baby, here as I am. Pull me close, try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now try and understand. The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take my hand come undercover, they can't hurt you now. Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers, because the night belongs to lust, because the night belongs to lovers, because the night belongs to us. Have I doubt when I'm alone? Love is a ring, the telephone. Love is an angel disguised as lust here in our bed until the morning comes. Come on now try and understand the way I feel under your command. Take my hand as the sun descends, they can't touch you now. Can't touch you now, can't touch you now. Because the night belongs to lovers, because the night belongs to lust, because the night belongs to lovers, because the night belongs to us. With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious circle. Turn and burns without you I cannot live. Forgive the yearning burning. I believe it's time, too real to feel. So touch me now touch me now, touch me now. Because the night belongs to lovers, because the night belongs to lust, because the night belongs to lovers, because the night belongs to us.	8
9281	The Covenant Hymn					Wherever you go, I will follow, wherever you live is my home. Though days be of blessing or sorrow, though house be of canvas or stone, though Eden be lost to the past, though mountains before us be vast, wherever you go, I am with you. I will never leave you alone. Whatever you dream, I am with you, when stars call your name in the night. Though shadows and mist cloud the future, together we bear there a light. Like Abram and Sarah we stand,  with only a promise in hand. But lead where you dream: I will follow. To dream with you is my delight. And though you should fall, you will find me, when no other friend can you claim, when foes beat you down or betray you, and others desert you in shame. When home and dreams aren’t enough, and you run away from my love, I’ll raise you from where you have fallen. "Faithful to you" is my name. Wherever you die, I will be there to sing you to sleep with a psalm, to soothe you with tales of our journey, your fears and doubts I will calm. We’ll live when journeys are done forever in mem’ry as one. And we will be buried together, and waken to greet a new dawn. Wherever you go, I will follow. Behold! The horizon shines clear. The possible gleams like a city: Together we’ve nothing to fear. So speak with words bold and true he message my heart speaks to you. You won’t be alone, I have promised. Wherever you go, I am here. 	7.5

9400	If I Ain't Got You	Alicia Keys	Brian & Angella	09.12.09		Some people live for the fortune, some people live just for the fame, some people live for the power, yeah, some people live just to play the game. Some people think that the physical things define what's within and I've been there before but that life's a bore so full of the superficial. Some people want it all but I don't want nothing at all if it ain't you, baby, if I ain't got you, baby. Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything but everything means nothing if I ain't got you, yeah. Some people search for a fountain that promises forever young. Some people need three dozen roses and that's the only way to prove you love them. Hand me the world on a silver platter and what good would it be. With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me. Some people want it all but I don't want nothing at all if it ain't you, baby, if I ain't got you, baby. Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything but everything means nothing if I ain't got you, you, you. Some people want it all but I don't want nothing at all if it ain't you, baby, if I ain't got you, baby.

So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing if I ain't got you with me, baby.	8

He said, "Yeah, I was eleven and times were tough, back in thirty-five. That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive a cotton farm, in the Great Depression. And if it looks like we were scared to death like a couple of kids just trying to save each other, you should've seen it in color." "This one here was taken overseas in the middle of hell, in nineteen forty-three. In the winter time, you can almost see my breath." "That was my tail gunner ole' Johnny McGee. He was a high school teacher from New Orleans and he had my back, right through the day we left." "If it looks like we were scared to death like a couple of kids just trying to save each other, you should've seen it in color. A picture's worth a thousand words but you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered, you should've seen it in color." "And this one is my favorite one.

When you went away you left a glowing spark, trying to be gay is whistling in the dark. I am only what you make me. Come take me, I'm yours how happy I would be to beg or borrow or sorrow with you. Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through. If we drift apart then I'll be lost alone though you used my heart just for a stepping stone.

How can I help dreaming of you, I love you I'm yours.	11

Across the sky, around the world. You've given me all you have and more. And no one else has ever shown me how to see the world the way I see it now. Oh, I, I never saw blue like that. I can't believe a month ago, I was alone, I didn't know you. I hadn't seen or heard you're name and even now, I'm so amazed. It's like a dream, It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain and somethings are the way they are and words just can't explain. Cause I never saw blue like that before, across the sky, around the world. You've given me all you have and more and no one else has ever shown me how to see the world the way I see it now. Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before. And it feels like now and it feels always, and it feels like coming home. I never saw blue like that before, across the sky around the world. You've given me all you have and more and no one else has ever shown me how to see the world the way I see it now. Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before. Oh, I, I never saw blue like that. 	8

Sogniamo un mondo senza più violenza. Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza. Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino. Simbolo di pace, e di fraternità. La forza che ci dà (We ask that life be kind). È il desiderio che (And watch us from above). Ognuno trovi amor (We hope each soul will find). Intorno e dentro a sé (Another soul to love). Let this be our prayer. Let this be our prayer. Just like every child. Just like every child. Need to find a place. Guide us with your grace. Give us faith so we'll be safe. È la fede che. Hai acceso in noi. Sento che ci salvera.	9
9457	One Great Mystery	Lady Antebellum	Tim & Amanda	25.05.19		I don't know how many stars fill the sky. I know we're here, but I don't know why.

I may not be a rich man but you can't call me poor 'cause I know how to love, I know how to love you well. And as we skip the light fandango from that ole jukebox by the bar, now honey don't it make you wonder how we ever got this far. I may not be a poet 'cause I ain't got much to say.

9929	Beginnings	Chicago	Brad & Trudy	03.22.13		When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are or what we're doing. I'm with you, that's all that matters. Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing. I wish I could sing it to you, oh no, I wish I could sing it to you. Mostly I'm silent. Never think about words to say. When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings. The color of chills all over my body and when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one. I should try to put into words, oh no, try to put into words. Mostly I'm silent. Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever. Only the beginning. Only just the start. I've got to get you into my life, got to get you next to me. Only the beginning. Only just the start.	11
9935	You Needed Me	Anne Murray	Wilson & Penny	08.27.83		I cried a tear, you wiped it dry. I was confused, you cleared my mind. I sold my soul, you bought it back for me and held me up and gave me dignity. Somehow you needed me. You gave me strength to stand alone again, to face the world out on my own again. You put me high upon a pedestal so high that I could almost see eternity, you needed me, you needed me. And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true. I needed you and you were there snd I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares. You held my hand when it was cold. When I was lost, you took me home. You gave me hope when I was at the end and turned my lies back into truth again. You even called me friend. You gave me strength to stand alone again to face the world out on my own again. You put me high upon a pedestal, so high that I could almost see eternity. You needed me, you needed me. You needed me, you needed me.	10
9938	Without You	Nielsen	Joe & Louise	11.09.73		Lost in paradise, bottled up inside, playing with dynamite 'bout to blow my mind. You're my saviour, I'm your prisoner. You have set me free, under your command, caught in your embrace, knowing that I am. Nobody without you but a wreck of a broken heart. Nobody without you, just a cry in the desert. Everything about you reveals that I am nobody without you but I keep trying, I keep on trying. Do you think of me? Do you care for me? Would you die for me like I'd die for you? Why I never said, I guess I was afraid you wouldn't feel the same. Loving you always. Nobody without you but a wreck of a broken heart. Nobody without you just a cry in the desert. Everything about you reveals that I am nobody without you, I keep on trying. In your eyes I see tomorrow chasing every cloud away. In your hands I feel no sorrow, you have saved me, you have made me. Nobody without you but a wreck of a broken heart. Nobody without you just a cry in the desert everything about you. Nobody without you but a wreck of a broken heart. Nobody without you, just a cry in the desert. Everything about you reveals that I am nobody without you but I keep trying, I keep on trying.	8.5

9872	Poem, Prayers and Promises	John Denver	Derrel & Janet	12.17.71		I've been lately thinking about my life's time. All the things I've done and how it's been and I can't help believing. In my own mind, I know I'm gonna hate to see it end. I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain. Spent a night or two all on my own, I've known my lady's pleasures. Had myself some friends and spent a time or two in my own home and I have to say it now. It's been a good life all in all. It's really fine to have a chance to hang around and lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire. While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around and talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in. How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care, how long it's been since yesterday and what about tomorrow and what about our dreams and all the memories we share. The days they pass so quickly now, nights are seldom long and time around me whispers when it's cold. The changes somehow frighten me. Still, I have to smile. It turns me on to think of growing old for though my life's been good to me. There's still so much to do, so many things my mind has never known. I'd like to raise a family, I'd like to sail away and dance across the mountains on the moon. I have to say it now, it's been a good life all in all, it's really fine to have the chance to hang around and lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire. While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around and talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in. How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care, how long it's been since yesterday what about tomorrow, what about our dreams and all the memories we share.	7

I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall. The closer you get, the further I fall. The things that you say to me, the look on your face, brings out the man in me.

I aint got much past to stand on 'cos I never planned on getting my hands on. No kind of cash or woman like you that could last a whole life through but now that you’re here, it seems so clear. Now I aint got no southern mansion and I aint much good at slow dancing. I never swam the English channel. People they say I’m hard to handle cos I’m like a candle in the wind. Where you ends where I begin and I’ll never win but I’m good at losing. But thank the Lord I’m good at choosing cos now that we’re here, it seems so clear.

They scream for more and the more I give, it takes a toll on the way we live. Please forgive me baby try and see. Yeah, try and see, please try and see, you get the best of me. I didn’t make no reservations, I didn’t plan no great vacation cos I’ve been chasing raindrops falling. Running from love when it keeps calling and I know you think I’m just playing the field. But let me show you girl what’s real cos I’m all in like a crazy gambler and though I don’t have all the answers since you’ve been here, it seems so clear.

Darling see, you got the best of me.	6.5
9881	Don't Stop Believing	Journey	Richard & Andrea	03.03.18		Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world. She took the midnight train goin' anywhere. Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit. He took the midnight train goin' anywhere. A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume. For a smile they can share the night. It goes on and on, and on, and on. Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights, people - living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night. Working hard to get my fill. Everybody wants a thrill - payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time. Some will win, some will lose. Some were born to sing the blues. Oh, the movie never ends - it goes on and on, and on, and on. Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlights, people - living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night. Don't stop believin', hold on to the feelin'. Streetlights, people. Don't stop believin', hold on. Streetlights, people. Don't stop believin', hold on to the feelin'. Streetlights, people.	9

10089	Thank You	Keith Urban	Nicki & Monroe	05.22.10		There were nights where I was sure I wouldn't see the morning sun and there were days that seemed so dark. I couldn't wait for night to come. I couldn't stand to think about how my life used to be and how without a single warning it all slipped away from me and like a fool I thought that I could fight the shadows on my own to the dark. I was no stranger but this was stronger than I'd known and by the time I knew that I was in too deep. I'd gone too far and the light that used to guide me had faded from my heart and I found myself in places I thought I'd never go. Surrounded by strangers, I was so far from home and I don't know how you found me. All I know is I owe you everything to you. Yes I do and I thank you for my heart, I thank you for my life and I thank god for grace and mercy and that you became my wife. I'm seeing for the first time the stars, the sun and moon but they've got nothing on the power of this love I have for you and I thank you, I thank you. Now people say they'll stand beside you. They swear they never leave but when the rain started falling, you know it only fell on me and it was hard to keep believing in myself when all I felt was so much pain and guilt and shame. I couldn't even ask for help. I don't know if I believe in other lives but when you came there was something so familar about the way you said my name. And the whole world started turning and I swear that I'd been born again brand new and it's all because of you and I thank you for my heart. I thank you for my life and I thank god for grace and mercy and that you became my wife. I'm seeing for the first time the stars, the sun and moon but they've got nothing on the power of this love I have for you and I thank you. And I've seen so many things that I just can't explain but the miracle of miracles is how with your love. I was saved and I thank you for my heart, I thank you for my life, I thank god for grace and mercy and that you became my wife. And I'm seeing for the first time the stars, the sun and moon but they've got nothing on the power of all this love I give to you. And I thank you for my heart, I thank you for my life, I thank god for grace and mercy and that you became my wife. The day I started breathing was the day you took my hand and 'till the day I die baby, I'll forever be your man and I thank you, I thank you. Oh, yes I do. Oh, don't you know that I thank you. Oh.	5.5

10094	Time after time	Cyndi Lauper	Adam & Jess	26.09.15		Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you. Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new. Flashback: warm nights, almost left behind. Suitcase of memories, time after. Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead. You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said. Then you say, "go slow," and I fall behind, the second hand unwinds. If you're lost you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting time after time. If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting time after time. After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray. Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay. Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside), and the drum beats out of time. If you're lost you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting time after time. If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting time after time. Time after time. I've got a suitcase of memories that I almost left behind, time after time, time, time, time. But you say to go slow but I fall behind time after time after time (after time, oh).	8

Set me free, oh, I pray closer to heaven above and closer to you. Closer to you.". I wanna walk and not run. I wanna skip and not fall.

Have you ever stayed up waiting for a telephone call just to hear her say hello 'cause you miss each other so. Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever tried to work it out but still she leaves you wondering what it's all about and when she's far away.

10136	Turn of the century	Yes	Neil & Gina 	09.18.98		Realising a form out of stone set hands moving, Roan shaped his heart through his working hands. Work to mold his passion into clay like the sun in his room. His lady, she would dance and sing so completely so be still he now cries. I have time, oh let clay transform thee so. In the deep cold of night winter calls, he cries "Don't deny me!" For his lady deep her illness, time has caught her and will for all reasons take her. In the still light of dawn, she dies helpless hands soul revealing. Like leaves we touch, we learn. We once knew the story as winter calls he will starve. All but to see the stone be life. Now Roan, no more tears set to work his strength so transformed him. Realising a form out of stone, his work so absorbed him. Could she hear him? Could she see him? All aglow was his room dazed in this light. He would touch her. He would hold her laughing as they danced highest colors touching others. Did her eyes at the turn of the century tell me plainly when we meet, how we'll love. Oh let life so transform me like leaves we touched, we danced. We once knew the story as autumn called and we both remembered all those many years ago I'm sure we know. As the sign with a touch as I kiss your fingers, we walk hands in the sun. Memories when we're young love lingers so was it sun through the haze that made all your looks as warm as moonlight? As a pearl deep in your eyes tears have flown away all the same light. Did her eyes at the turn of the century tell me plainly when we meet how we'll look as we smile time will leave me clearly like leaves, we touch we see. We will know the story as autumn calls we'll both remember all those many years ago.	7

10303	Voices on the Wind	Little Feat	Michael & Karrie	05.22.93		Standing by the ocean, watch it tear away the shore. Glide out upon the desert, the horizon is the door. And though your voice is shouting above the wind, it can't be heard. Drop all sense of reason, it's there you'll find your worth. And though you are surrounded, feeling quite alone, there's a light to guide you home. If you stand with your face to the wind off the water at the point of lands end where the ocean begins, look to the memory of the ones gone before. The light and meaning of the voices on the wind searching for safe passage as you knock on every door. You still can hear the howling of the mongrel dogs of war. You call our for some comfort seeking shelter from the night. A raging rain's upon you feeling tired of the fight. And though you are surrounded, feeling quite alone, there's a light to guide you home. If you stand with your face to the wind off the water at the point of lands end where the ocean begins, look to the memory of the ones gone before. The light and meaning of the voices on the wind, thier words carry over water, and fall back down to earth. What follows is the silence as you contemplate their worth. A vision comes before you, but the meaning's still unclear. Standing at the threshold as you watch it disappear. And though you are surrounded, feeling quite alone, there's a light to guide you home. If you stand with your face to the wind off the water at the point of lands end where the ocean begins, look to the memory of the ones gone before the light and meaning of the voices on the wind.	7
10306	Love Will Keep Us Together	Captain & Tennille	Tim & Karen	04.04.20		Love, love will keep us together. Think of me, babe whenever. Some sweet talking girl comes along singing his song. Don't mess around, you just got to be strong. Just stop cause I really love you. Stop, I'll be thinking of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. You, you belong to me now, ain't gonna set you free now. When those girls start hanging around, talking me down, hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound. Just stop cause I really love you. Stop, I'll be thinking of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. Young and beautiful, someday your looks will be gone. When the others turn you off, who'll be turnin' you on, I will, I will, I will, I will be there to share forever. Love will keep us together. I said it before and I'll say it again, while others pretend I need you now and I need you then. Just stop cause I really love you. Stop, I'll be thinking of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. Whatever, whatever, I will, I will, I will, I will. You better stop cause I really love you. Stop, I've been thinkin' of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. Whatever, whatever, I will, I will, I will.	9

10317	Dance with Me	Philip Phillips	Rich & Bonnie	06.29.19		I have seen a sunset in the western sky, ain't nothin' like the brightness in your eyes. And I have seen the moon reflecting in the sea but that don't compare to how you shine on me. After everything I've seen, I rather see you smile. Cause all I really want is just to hold you for a while and be your man. So will you dance with me? I will lead you, give every moment that I have just to be near you. And when the song ends and everyone else leaves, will you dance one more with me? When my hands are heavy and your words are slow, kiss my lips and tell me you won't let me go.

If you pay the price, she'll let you deep inside but there's a secret garden she hides. She'll let you in her car to go drivin' 'round. She'll let you into the parts of herself that'll bring you down. She'll let you in her heart if you got a hammer and a vise but into her secret garden, don't think twice. You've gone a million miles, how far'd you get to that place where you can't remember and you can't forget? She'll lead you down a path, there'll be tenderness in the air. She'll let you come just far enough. So you know she's really there then she'll look at you and smile and her eyes will say she's got a secret garden where everything you want, where everything you need will always stay a million miles away.	11
10319	Wagon Wheel	Old Crow Medicine Show	Eric & Amy	02.09.07		Headed down south to the land of the pines, I'm thumbin' my way to North Caroline. Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights.

10335	Just Like Heaven	The Cure	Chris & Vickie	02.21.91		"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick. The one that makes me scream," she said. "The one that makes me laugh," she said. Threw her arms around my neck. Show me how you do it and I'll promise you. I'll promise that I'll run away with you, I'll run away with you. Spinning on that dizzy edge, kissed her face and kissed her head. Dreamed of all the different ways, I had to make her glow. "Why are you so far away?" she said. Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you? That I'm in love with you? You, soft and only, you lost and lonely. You, strange as angels dancing in the deepest oceans, twisting in the water. You're just like a dream. You're just like a dream. Daylight licked me into shape. I must have been asleep for days. And moving lips to breathe her name. I opened up my eyes and found myself alone, alone, alone above a raging sea. That stole the only girl I loved and drowned her deep inside of me. You, soft and only. You, lost and lonely. You, just like heaven.	10

10397	Sweet child of mine	Guns N' Roses	Steve & Brenda	08.11.90		She's got a smile it seems to me reminds me of childhood memories where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky, now and then when I see her face. She takes me away to that special place and if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry. Oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine. Oh oh oh oh sweet love of mine. She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child, I'd hide and pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by. Oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine. Oh oh oh oh, sweet love of mine. Oh oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine. Oh oh oh oh, sweet love of mine. Oh oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine. Oh yeah yeah. Oh oh sweet love of mine. Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go? Oh oh.

10400	Someone to watch over me	Ella Fitzgerald	Andria & Steve	06.03.89		There's a saying old, says that love is blind. Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find. So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind. Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet. He's the big affair I cannot forget, only man I ever think of with regret. I'd like to add his initial to my monogram. Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb. There's a somebody I'm longin' to see. I hope that he turns out to be someone who'll watch over me. I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood. I know I could, always be good to one who'll watch over me. Although he may not be the man some girls think of as handsome, to my heart he carries the key. Won't you tell him please to put on some speed. Follow my lead, oh, how I need, someone to watch over me. Won't you tell him please to put on some speed. Follow my lead, oh, how I need, someone to watch over me, someone to watch over me.	10

Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home because I haven't got one anymore. Take me out tonight because I want to see people and I want to see life.Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home because it's not my home, it's theirs home and I'm welcome no more. And if a double-decker bus crashes into us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die.

10347	I Found Love	Bebe Winans	Stacy & Gerald	10.10.16		When I found you, I found somebody who cares. When I found you, found my most intimate prayer.

In my world before you, I lived outside my emotions, didn't know where I was going. Until that day I found you - how you opened my life to a new paradise. In a world torn by change. Still with all of my heart, until my dying day. I do, cherish you. For the rest of my life. You don't have to think twice. I will, love you still, from the depths of my soul. It's beyond my control. I've waited so long to say this to you. If you're asking do I love you this much, yes I do. I've waited so long to say this to you. So, if you're asking if I love you this much, I do. Oh, I do.	9

You're the fire and the flood and I'll always feel you in my blood. Everything is fine when your hand is resting next to mine.  Next to mine, you're the fire and the flood. Since we met I feel a lightness in my step. You're miles away but I still feel you. Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere). Anywhere I go there you are. Late at night when you can't fall asleep, I'll be lying right beside you counting sheep. Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere). Anywhere I go there you are (anywhere). There you are. There you are. You're the fire and the flood and I'll always feel you in my blood. Everything is fine when your hand is resting next to mine, next to mine. You're the fire and the flood. Now listen here she said, “Boy when you know you'll know and I know you're the fire and the flood and I'll always feel you in my blood. Everything is fine when your hand is resting next to mine. Next to mine, you're the fire and the flood.”	8

10477	Power of two	Indigo Girls	Lynne Marie & Micheal T	08.22.98		Now the parking lot is empty, everyone's gone someplace. I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed, a cooler and a 2-day suitcase. Cause there's a place we like to drive, way out in the country. Five miles out of the city limit we're singing and your hands upon my knee so we're okay, we're fine. Baby I'm here to stop your crying. Chase all the ghosts from your head. I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed, smarter than the tricks played on your heart. We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart adding up the total of a love that's true, multiply life by the power of two. You know the things that I am afraid of. I'm not afraid to tell and if we ever leave a legacy, it's that we loved each other well 'cause I've seen the shadows of so many people trying on the treasures of youth. But a road that fancy and fast ends, ends in a fatal crash and I'm glad we got off to tell you the truth 'cause we're okay, we're fine. Baby I'm here to stop your crying. Chase all the ghosts from your head. I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed, smarter than the tricks played on your heart. We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart adding up the total of a love that's true. Multiply life by the power of two. All the shiny little trinkets of temptation (Make new friends). Something new instead of something old (But keep the old). All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface (But remember what is gold) and it's fool’s gold. (What is gold) Fool’s gold (What is gold). Fool’s gold. Now we're talking about a difficult thing and your eyes are getting wet. I took us for better and I took us for worse, don't you ever forget it. Now the steel bars between me and a promise suddenly bend with ease. The closer I'm bound in love to you, the closer I am to free so we're okay, we're fine. Baby I'm here to stop your crying. Chase all the ghosts from your head. I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed, smarter than the tricks played on your heart. We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart adding up the total of a love that's true. Multiply life by the power of two. 	6
10484	When the right one comes along	Sam Palladio & Clare Bowen	Randall & Carmen	01.11.20		There's no music, no confetti, crowds don't cheer, and bells don't ring but you'll know it, I can guarantee. When the right one comes along, what they're thinkin', what you're feelin', you no longer have to guess. All those questions are finally put to rest when the right one comes along.

All that changes is only everything when the right one comes along.	10
10488	How 'bout us	Champaign	Mike & Elisabeth	07.29.16		Oooh, short and sweet. No sense in draggin' on past our needs. Let's don't keep it hangin' on, if the fire's out we should both be gone. Some people are made for each other. Some people can love one another for life. How 'bout us? Some people can hold it together, last through all kinds of weather? Can we? Now don't you get me wrong (What you sayin' to me, baby?) 'cause I'm not tryin' now to end it all (Let's start something new).

How 'bout us?	7
10489	Annie's Song	John Denver	Lynn & Jerry	10.17.87		You fill up my senses like a night in a forest, like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean. You fill up my senses. Come, fill me again. Come, let me love you. Let me give my life to you; let me drown in your laughter. Let me die in your arms; let me lay down beside you. Let me always be with you. Come, let me love you. Come, love me again. You fill up my senses like a night in a forest, like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean. You fill up my senses. Come, fill me again.	11
10492	Need you now	Lady Antebellum	Justin & Becky	05.13.13		Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor.  Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore. And I wonder if I ever cross your mind? For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now. Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now. Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door. Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before. And I wonder if I ever cross your mind? For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now. Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now. Oh, whoa, guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all. It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now. And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now. I just need you now, oh, baby, I need you now.	9
10494	Is that alright	Lady Gaga	Scott & Lauren	01.19.20		Life is so simple, a little boy, a little girl laughing and loving tryin' to figure out the world. It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain and I know your story but tell me again. Nothing you say wouldn't interest me all of your words are like poems to me. I would be honored if you would take me as I am. I want you to look right in my eyes, to tell me you love me, to be by my side. I want you at the end of my life. I wanna see your face when I fall with grace at the moment I die. Is that alright? Is that alright? I hope you're still with me when I'm not quite myself and I pray that you'll lift me. When you know I need help. It's a warm celebration of all of our years I dream of our story of our fairy-tale. Family dinners and family trees, teachin' the kids to say, "Thank you" and "Please" knowin' if we stay together that things will be right. I want you to look right in my eyes, to tell me you love me, to be by my side. I want you at the end of my life. Wanna see your face when I fall with grace at the moment I die. Is that alright? Is that alright? Is that alright?	9
10498	Lost without you	Robin Thicke	Jeff & Gina	06.20.09		I'm lost without you, can't help myself. How does it feel to know that I love you, baby? I'm lost without you, can't help myself.

10500	The very thought of you	Nat King Cole	Joshua & Erica	03.02.02		The very thought of you and I forget to do the little ordinary things that everyone ought to do. I'm living in a kind of daydream; I'm happy as a king. And foolish though it may seem, to me that's everything. The mere idea of you, the longing here for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go 'till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you, my love. The mere idea of you, the longing here for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go 'till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you, my love.	11
10665	How Does a Moment Last Forever	Celine Dion	Dillon & Victoria	08.17.19		How does a moment last forever? How can a story never die? It is love we must hold onto, never easy, but we try. Sometimes our happiness is captured, somehow, our time and place stand still. Love lives on inside our hearts and always will. Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone. But when all else has been forgotten, still our song lives on. Maybe some moments weren't so perfect. Maybe some memories not so sweet. But we have to know some bad times or our lives are incomplete. Then when the shadows overtake us, just when we feel all hope is gone, we'll hear our song and know once more our love lives on. How does a moment last forever? How does our happiness endure? Through the darkest of our troubles, love is beauty, love is pure. Love pays no mind to desolation it flows like a river through the soul. Protects, proceeds, and perseveres and makes us whole. Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone but when all else has been forgotten, still our song lives on. How does a moment last forever: when our song lives on.	9
10672	Dreams	Fleetwood Mac	Mike & Jane	07.01.78		Now here you go again. You say you want your freedom, well, who am I to keep you down? It's only right that you should play the way you feel it. But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness. Like a heartbeat, drives you mad. In the stillness of remembering what you had and what you lost, and what you had and what you lost. Thunder only happens when it's raining. Players only love you when they're playing. Say women, they will come and they will go. When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know. Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions. I keep my visions to myself. It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams. And have you any dreams you'd like to sell? Dreams of loneliness. Like a heartbeat, drives you mad. In the stillness of remembering what you had and what you lost, and what you had and what you lost.Thunder only happens when it's raining. Players only love you when they're playing. Women, they will come and they will go. When the rain washes you clean, you'll know. Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining. Players only love you when they're playing. Say women, they will come and they will go. When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know. You will know, you'll know.	8
10675	Someone to Give my Love To	Johnny Paycheck	Jimmy & Dianna	05.18.93		I could search from now to the end of time and never find another you. I'm so glad because I know your mine, someone to give my love to. I believe, my love, that your one of a kind for there's no one else like you. You're the light of my life, so let it shine, someone to give my love to. I find happiness is lovin' you. I'll do my best to make your dreams all come true. I will follow you to the ends of the earth for my place will be with you. I have taken you for better or worse, someone to give my love to. I find happiness is lovin' you. I do my best to make your dreams all come true. Days of man and wife, time are precious and few. I will spend them all with you then beyond forever, I'll wait for you, someone to give my love to.	11
10676	I Don't Know Much, but I Know I Love You	Lionel Richie	Dan & Jodie	05.02.15		Look at this face I know the years are showing. Look at this life I still don't know where it's going. I don't know much but I know I love you that may be all I need to know. Look at these eyes they never seen what matters. Look at these dreams so beaten and so battered. I don't know much but I know I love you that may be all I need to know. So many questions still left unanswered. So much I've never broken through and when I feel you near me, sometimes I see so clearly. That only truth I'll never know is me and you. Look at this man so blessed with inspiration. Look at this soul still searching for salvation. I don't know much but I know I love you that may be all I need to know. I don't know much but I know I love you that may be all I need to know. I don't know much but I know I love you that may be all there is to know.	10

10681	Shining Star	The Grahams	The Grahams			Honey, you are my shining star. Don't you go away. Wanna be right here where you are until my dying day?

Give my love to you only, to you only, to you only. Honey, you are my shining star. Don't you go away. Wanna be right here where you are until my dying day.

Honey I'll never leave you lonely, give my love to you only, to you only, to you only. Honey, you are my shining star. Don't you go away. Wanna be right here where you are until my dying day.	10
10682	Lover's Eyes	Mumford & Sons	Mike & Rebecca	11.08.13		Well, love was kind for a time. Now just aches and it makes me blind. This mirror holds my eyes too bright I can't see the others in my life. Were we too young? Our heads too strong? To bear the weight of these lover's eyes. 'Cause I feel numb, beneath your tongue, beneath the curse of these lover's eyes. But do not ask the price I paid. I must live with my quiet rage, tame the ghosts in my head, that run wild and wish me dead. Should you shake my ash to the wind, Lord, forget all of my sins. Oh, let me die where I lie, 'neath the curse of my lover's eyes. 'Cause there's no drink or drug I've tried to rid the curse of these lover's eyes. And I feel numb, beneath your tongue, your strength just makes me feel less strong. But do not ask the price I paid. I must live with my quiet rage, tame the ghosts in my head, that run wild and wish me dead. Should you shake my ash to the wind, Lord, forget all of my sins or let me die where I lie 'meath the curse of my lover's eyes. And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow. Take my hand, help me on my way. And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow. Take my hand, I'll be on my way. And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow. Take my hand, help me on my way. And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow. Take my hand, I'll be on my way.	8
10683	Love the World Away	Kenny Rogers	Linda & Michael	10.30.81		Every now and then when the world steps in stealing all our time away. It soon takes so much we forget to touch. That's when I know it's time for me to say, "Take my hand. Let's walk through love's door and be free from the world once more. Here's my heart, we can hide today and love the world away." Once again we'll be where our hearts are free and the time is ours to share. Love will always stay, just a touch away. Come with me, all the magic's waiting there.

10684	I Never Thought	Dan Hill	Amy & Todd	11.01.13		Can I touch you? I can't believe that you are real. How did I ever find you? You are the dream that saved my life, you are the reason I survived. Baby, I never thought that I could love someone as much as I love you. I know it's crazy but it's true. I never thought that I could need someone as much as I need you, I Love You. Can I hold you?

I never thought that I could need someone as much as I need you, I Love You.	9
10687	L-O-V-E	Nat King Cole	Henry & Michelle	08.07.04		L is for the way you look at me. O is for the only one I see. V is very, very extraordinary. E is even more than anyone that you adore and Love is all that I can give to you. Love is more than just a game for two. Two in love can make it. Take my heart and please don't break it. Love was made for me and you. L is for the way you look at me. O is for the only one I see. V is very, very extraordinary.

10688	Candle in the Wind	Elton John	Eric Michael Domingue	09.21.10		Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all. You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled. They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain. They set you on the treadmill and they made you change your name. And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in. And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did. Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played. Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid. Even when you died, oh, the press still hounded you. All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude. And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in. And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did. Goodbye Norma Jean though I never knew you at all. You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled. Goodbye Norma Jean from the young man in the 22nd row who sees you as something more than sexual, more than just our Marilyn Monroe. And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in. And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did. Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.	7
10689	Stand by Me	Prince Royce	Ron & Mari	11.29.14		When the night, has come and the land is dark y la luna es la luz que brilla ante mi. Miedo no, no tendre, oh I wont, no me asustare. Just as long as you stand, stand by me. And darling, darling stand by me, oh, stand by me, oh stand, junto a mi, junto a mi. Y aunque las montanas o el cielo caiga no voy a preocuparme porque se que tu estas, junto a mi. No llorare, no llorare oh, I won't shed a tear porque se, que tu estas junto a mi. Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me. That's class right there and darling, darling stand by me oh stand by me. Oh stand, junto a mi, junto a mi. And darling, darling stand by me oh stand by me, oh stand, junto a mi, junto a mi.	11
10690	Nightswimming	REM	Doug & Sarah	07.29.06		Nightswimming deserves a quiet night. The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago, turned around backwards so the windshield shows. Every street light reveals a picture in reverse, still it's so much clearer. I forgot my shirt at the water's edge, the moon is low tonight. Nightswimming deserves a quiet night, I'm not sure all these people understand. It's not like years ago, the fear of getting caught, the recklessness in water, they cannot see me naked. These things they go away replaced by every day. Nightswimming, remembering that night. September's coming soon, I'm pining for the moon. And what if there were two, side by side in orbit around the fairest sun? The bright tide forever drum could not describe nightswimming. You, I thought I knew you. You, I cannot judge. You, I thought you knew me. This one laughing quietly underneath my breath, Nightswimming.  The photograph reflects every street light a reminder. Nightswimming, deserves a quiet night, deserves a quiet night.	9
10692	So Close	Jon McLaughlin	Jason & Makayla	05.05.10		You're in my arms, and all the world is calm. The music playing on for only two. So close, together, and when I'm with you. So close, to feeling alive. A life goes by, Romantic dreams must die. So I bid mine goodbye and never knew.So close, was waiting, waiting here with you. And now, forever, I know. All that I wanted to hold you so close. So close to reaching that famous happy end. Almost believing this one's not pretend. And now you're beside me and look how far we've come. So far we are. So close. Oh how could I face the faceless days if I should lose you now? We're so close to reaching that famous happy end. And almost believing this one's not pretend. Let's go on dreaming for we know we are so close, so close and still so far.	12
10694	Living in a Moment	Ty Herndon	Blake & Darlayna	10.03.98		Well, the world just lost two lonely people. The world just lost two broken hearts. The odds were against it but baby here we are in our own little place, in our own little corner. This old cold world just got a little warmer. For the rest of my life I'm gonna hold you in my arms. And when they carve my stone, all they'll need to write on it is "Once lived a man who got all he ever wanted." Tell me something who could ask for more then to be living in a moment you would die for. If I never get rich on what money can buy, it don't matter to me and I'll tell you why. I've got it all when I'm holding you this way. I'll live to love you. I'd die to keep you safe inside these arms that need you. I'll be loving you with the very last breath I take. And when they carve my stone, all they'll need to write on it is "Once lived a man who got all he ever wanted." Tell me something who could ask for more then to be living in a moment you would die for. Ashes to ashes, dust into dust. I'll lay beside you forever in love. And when they carve my stone, all they'll need to write on it is "Once lived a man who got all he ever wanted." Tell me something who could ask for more then to be living in a moment you would die for. Living in a moment I would die for.	8
10710	From the Heart of Me	Grateful Dead	Leslie & Gregory	09.30.89		Voices slide down off the mountain, sunlight turning red, falls on the earth and it spreads. Even the families lower their heads as they ride. Age old faces of the mountains looming naturally. I wonder if they're looking at me, their monumental eyes I can feel. In the glow of the twilight the thought of home reminds me now I'm reaching out to you. Anything I can do to be safe and warm in your arms, all I have from the heart of you. I'd meet you anywhere in the country or anywhere on the sea. All over the world it could be I would follow you with the heart of me. Remembering you hold me tight in tomorrow morning's light I will find you. When I awoke, the stars were out and shining, shining for you and me. All I ever want to be is save and warm in your arms. All I have, from the heart of me.	10
10714	This is Us	Mark Knopfler & Emmylou Harris	Jay & Kathy	08.25.18		This is us down at the Mardi Gras. This is us in your Daddy's car.  You and the missing link, yeah, I'd had a little too much to drink now. Too long in the sun, having too much fun. You and me and our memories, this is us. Rocking at the barbecue. Yeah, when we said I do, hand jiving on the Ballroom floor. You in that wedding coat you wore and you in that amazing dress. I was stoned on love I guess, you and me we were meant to be, this is us. This is us on our Honeymoon, in our hotel room. Sitting by the wishing well, checking out of the love motel. Making plans for the sunshine state, waiting at the terminal gate. You and me making history, this is us. And our baby boy with our pride and joy. You at the Sunday game standing next to What's-hisname. On our Anniversary, with the family. You and me and our memories, this is us.	10
10719	Nobody Loves Me Like You Do	Anne Murray	Tracie & Joe	04.02.16		Like a candle burnin' bright, love is flowing in your eyes. A flame to light our way that burns brighter every day. Now I have you nobody loves me like you do. Like a leaf upon the wind I could find no place to land. I dreamed the hours away, wondered every day. Do dreams come true? Nobody loves me like you do. What if I never met you? Where would I be right now? Funny how life just falls in place somehow. You touched my heart in places that I never even knew. Nobody loves me like you do. I was words without a tune. I was a song still unsung, a poem with no rhyme, dancer out of time but now there's you. Nobody loves me like you do. What if I never met you? Where would I be right now? Funny how life just falls in place somehow. You touched my heart in places that I never even knew. Nobody loves me, nobody loves me, nobody loves me like you do. Nobody loves me like you do.	9.5
11033	Valentine's Day	Bruce Springsteen	Philip and Betsy	05.02.92		I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark. I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart. It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through. And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you. A friend of mine became a father last night. When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light of the skies and the rivers, the timberwolf in the pines. And that great jukebox out on Route 39. They say he travels fastest who travels alone. But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home. Is it the sound of the leaves left blown by the wayside? That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight. Is it the cry of the river with the moonlight shining through? That ain't what scares me baby, what scares me is losing you. They say if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed. But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head and God's light came shinin' on through. I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew. It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me. It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true. It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms. No no baby it was you. So hold me close honey say you're forever mine and tell me you'll be my lonely valentine.	8
11034	La Vie En Rose	Édith Piaf	Andrew & Hannah	04.04.15		Des yeux qui font baisser les miens. Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche. Voilà le portrait sans retouche. De l'homme auquel j'appartiens. Quand il me prend dans ses bras. Il me parle tout bas. Je vois la vie en rose. Il me dit des mots d'amour. Des mots de tous le jours. Et ça me fait quelque chose. Il est entré dans mon coeur. Une part de bonheur. Dont je connais la cause. C'est lui pour moi. Moi pour lui. Dans la vie. Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie. Et dès que je l'aperçois. Alors je sens en moi, mon coeur qui bat. When he takes me in his arms, and whispers love to me. Everything's lovely. It's him for me and me for him, all our lives. And it's so real what I feel. This is why. Et dès que je l'aperçois. Alors je sens en moi, mon coeur qui bat. La vie. La vie en rose, la vie en rose. Ohh, la vie. La vie en rose. La vie en rose, la vie en rose. La vie en rose, la vie en rose. La vie en rose, la vie en rose. La vie en rose, la vie en rose. Je t'aime voir toujours.	9.5
10720	Fascinación	Carlos Rivera	Dan & Jenny	07.14.18		Nunca pensé repetir la frase, contigo aprendí que nunca es tarde, para aprender a flotar. Muerto y sin fe, me dolió quebrarme, En ti descubrí mil formas de levantarme, y me entregué al amor. Quédate por siempre a mi lado, es real lo que siento, mi vida lo entendí cuando te conocí. Yo que no creía más en eso, fue el poder de tu amor, lo que me hizo caer en esta fascinación. En esta fascinación, en esta fascinación, esta fascinación que me da tu amor. La bendición que me dan tus besos,son lo mejor en lo único que me quedó, cuando no estás junto a mí. Quédate por siempre a mi lado, es real lo que siento, mi vida, lo entendí cuando te conocí. Yo que no creía más en esto, fue el poder de tu amor, lo que me hizo caer en esta fascinación.	11
10721	The Promise	Tracy Chapman	Mick & Sandra	01.07.19		If you wait for me then I'll come for you. Although I've traveled far, I always hold a place for you in my heart. If you think of me, if you miss me once in a while, then I'll return to you. I'll return and fill that space in your heart remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace. I'll find my way back to you, if you'll be waiting. If you dream of me like I dream of you in a place that's warm and dark, in a place where I can feel the beating of your heart.

And here in my heart you will stay while I pray.My prayer is to linger with you at the end of the day in a dream that's divine. My prayer is a rapture in blue, with the world far away and your lips close to mine. Tonight while our hearts are aglow, oh, tell me the words that I'm longing to know.

10726	Loving Wings	Dave Matthews Band	Sarah & Adam	12.31.11		My heart is made of broken bones. My soul a bag of sticks and stones. And you along this dusty road have come my love to take me home. I give to you my everything. You've given me these loving wings. The angels have all gathered 'round. To hear me sing my love out loud. They lightly lifted me away above a darkness cold and gray. I work beneath the midday sun. My cold blue water you have come. I give to you my everything. You've given me these loving wings. The angels have all gathered 'round to hear me sing my love out loud. So take your place here next to me. I'll take my place there next to thee. No matter how far we may roam. It's by your side I make my home. I give to you my everything.

10729	The Story	Sara Ramirez	Jennifer & Clare			All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am. So many stories of where I've been and how I got to where I am. But these stories don't mean anything when you've got no one to tell them to. It's true, I was made for you. I climbed across the mountaintops, swam all across the ocean blue. I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules but, baby, I broke them all for you. Oh because even when I was flat broke, you made me feel like a million bucks. You do, and I was made for you.  You see the smile that's on my mouth. It's hiding the words that don't come out. And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed they don't know my head is a mess. No, they don't know who I really am and they don't know what I've been through like you do, and I was made for you. All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am. So many stories of where I've been and how I got to where I am. Oh, but these stories don't mean anything when you've got no one to tell them to.

10736	Vissi d'arte	Puccini	Donald & Karl	07.18.14		Vissi d’arte, vissi d’amore, non feci mai male ad anima viva! Con man furtiva quante miserie conobbi aiutai. Sempre con fè sincera la mia preghiera ai santi tabernacoli salì. Sempre con fè sincera diedi fiori agl’altar. Nell’ora del dolore perchè, perchè, Signore, perchè me ne rimuneri così? Diedi gioielli della Madonna al manto, e diedi il canto agli astri, al ciel, che ne ridean più belli. Nell’ora del dolor perchè, perchè, Signor, ah, perchè me ne rimuneri così?	14

Every move you make, every vow you break. Every smile you fake, every claim you stake I'll be watching you. Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace.

10744	Mi Bendicion	Juan Luis Guerra	Gabriela & Sergio	01.08.11		Dicen que las flores no dejaban de cantar tu nombre, tu nombre cariño. Que las olas de los mares te hicieron un chal de espuma, de nubes y lirios. Y la luna no se convenció y bajo a mirarte el corazón. Y al mirarte dijo que había visto un sol radiante, mas bello que mi bendición. Tenerte, besarte, andar de la mano contigo. Mi cielo, mirarte, decirte un te quiero al oído. Yo te lo digo, que bendición. Dicen que las palmas aplaudían al oír tu pasos, tus pasos cariño. Que los ríos salen de su cauce al contemplar tus ojos, tus ojos divinos. Y un lucero no se convenció y bajo a mirarte el corazón. Y al mirarte dijo que no había visto luna llena, mas bella que mi bendición. Tenerte, besarte, andar de la mano contigo. Mi cielo, mirarte, decirte un te quiero al oído. Yo te lo digo, que bendición. Cuando me hablas oigo un coro de amor para dos. El falsete de un te quiero pegado a tu voz, que bendición. Tenerte, besarte, andar de la mano contigo. Mi cielo, mirarte, decirte un te quiero al oído. Yo te lo digo, que bendición.	9
10746	Because It's Really Love	Luther Vandross	Robert & Natalie	09.23.95		I used to be afraid that you were never gonna love me this way. But I feel better now. No one could ever say to me, it's such a shame you're a lonely guy because you love is mine. And now we know our love is ever so true. I think we know it 'cause you feel the way I do. I can't imagine me without you, my dear and I'm so glad about the reaon that you came here. Because it's love, because it's love, because it's really love. Because it's love, because it's all the way love, because it's really love. Oooh, girl you gotta stay 'cause I wanna fill your day with happiness. 'Cause I'm in love you see, there's so much I wanna say. And you'll hear the words to make you fall in love, deep in love with me. I used to say I love you every day to make you really know, to trust in the things I say. But look at me now and you can clearly see the love I feel for you. You don't need words from me. Because it's love, because it's love, because it's really love. Because it's love, because it's all the way love, because it's really love. When you walked into the crowded room, you sent my rocket to the moon. But little did I know that you would change my life. But you kept saying take it slow, I love you for the things you know. 'Cause now I'll never spend another lonely night, at night. I wanna be your friend after the lovin' ends. It's not over then, you see it just begins. And all anyone can say is, oooh wee you've got it made. And may the best of love always come your way. And I don't worry how much I fall when the feelin' starts to call. Because it's really love and all my worries fall into place when I think about your face because it's really love.	7
10754	A Whole New World	Lea Salonga & Brad Kane	Josiah & Jenifer	02.24.07		I can show you the world - shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder. Over, sideways and under on a magic carpet ride. A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world a dazzling place I never knew. But now from way up here, it's crystal clear that now I'm in a whole new world with you. Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling, soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky. A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes), a hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better). I'm like a shooting star I've come so far. I can't go back to where I used to be. A whole new world with new horizons to pursue. I'll chase them anywhere there's time to spare. Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world (a whole new world), a new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world (every turn a surprise), with new horizons to pursue (every moment red-letter). I'll chase them anywhere there's time to spare. Anywhere, there's time to spare. Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world (a whole new world). That's where we'll be (where we will be): a thrilling chase (a wondrous place) for you and me.	7
10755	Setting the World on Fire	Kenny Chesney & Pink	Olga & Pam			Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard, takin' pictures of people we thought were stars. It's easy to give in to your heart when you're drunk on La Cienega Boulevard. When the song comin' out of the speakers was the band that you had on your t-shirt, we were screamin' cause all the streets were empty and you kissed me, and we were up all night and we were feelin' so good. Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should. We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights. We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes, setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire. Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror. We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier. Said "Do you think we'll live forever?" as we killed another beer. And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror. We were laughin' until we were breathless. Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless. And comin' alive and we were up all night and we were feelin' so good. Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should. We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights. We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire. Yeah and we were up all night and we were feelin' so good. Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should. We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights.

We were setting the world on fire, world on fire.	7
10758	More Than Everything	Rhett Akins	Aaron & Morgan	06.11.16		Long before the first beats of our hearts. Somehow, someone knew that you belonged here in my arms and now that I've got you. Girl, I'm amazed every day how you make my life complete in every way. But when I start to question just how on earth you found me. All I really have to do is stop and look around me. He shows the rivers where to run. Struck the match that lit the sun. He writes the songs the birds sing, makes the flowers bloom in spring. But of all the things he's done, He made me for you and you for me. And that's more than everything. My heart's telling me each time we touch. This love has always been bigger than the both of us. As I look into your eyes darling, now there's no doubt. I know you're the one thing I could never live without. I'm forever thankful for all the gifts in my life. And I feel there is someone smiling down on us tonight. He shows the rivers where to run. Struck the match that lit the sun. He writes the songs the birds sing, makes the flowers bloom in spring. But of all the things he's done, He made me for you and you for me, and that's more than everything. But of all the things he's done, He made me for you and you for me. And that's more than everything, more than everything.	8
10805	Fallin in Love Again	Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds	Robert & Sherry 	06.20.80		Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again. Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again.

Baby, baby, fallin' in love, I'm fallin' in love again. It seems like yesterday, you and I first loved this way. But now I know how love can grow with each and every day.

10839	Stay in my corner	The Arcs	Annie & Serge	05.09.2020		I won't always be a winner babe. In fact, I'm bound to burn all these bumps in the road. Dear they're just lessons we learned, we learned. Stay in my corner babe. Stay in my corner, please. Stay in my corner, babe. I will fight for you if you fight for me too. They can steal away my soul, hang it dangerously low. I don't care for they go 'cause I've been down there before, before. Stay in my corner babe. Stay in my corner, please. Stay in my corner babe. I will fight for you if you fight for me too.

I will fight for you if you fight for me too. 	10
10841	Lost together	Blue Rodeo	Gerry & Amanda	10.09.2004		Strange and beautiful are the stars tonight that dance around your head. In your eyes I see that perfect world, I hope that doesn't sound too weird. And I want all the world to know that your love's all I need, all that I need. And if we're lost, then we are lost together. If we're lost, then we are lost together. I stand before this faceless crowd and I wonder why I bother. So much controlled by so few, stumbling from one disaster to another, I've heard it all so many times before. It's all a dream to me now, a dream to me now. And if we're lost, then we are lost together. If we're lost, then we are lost together. In the silence of this whispered night I listen only to your breath. And that second of a shooting star somehow it all makes sense. And I want all the world to know that your love's all I need, all that I need. And if we're lost, then we are lost together. If we're lost, then we are lost together.	10
10843	Wind beneath my wings	Bette Midler	Tim & Niki	05.22.92		Oh oh oh oh oh It must have been cold there in my shadow to never have sunlight on your face. You were content to let me shine, that's your way. You always walked a step behind so I was the one with all the glory while you were the one with all the strength, a beautiful face without a name for so long a beautiful smile to hide the pain. Did you ever know that you're my hero and everything I would like to be? I can fly higher than an eagle for you are the wind beneath my wings. It might have appeared to go unnoticed but I've got it all here in my heart. I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it I would be nothing without you. Did you ever know that you're my hero? You're everything I wish I could be. I could fly higher than an eagle for you are the wind beneath my wings. Did I ever tell you you're my hero? You're everything, everything I wish I could be. Oh and I, I could fly higher than an eagle for you are the wind beneath my wings 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings. Oh the wind beneath my wings. You You You, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly fly fly away, you let me fly so high. Oh you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Oh you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Fly fly fly high against the sky so high I almost touch the sky. Thank you. Thank you. Thank God for you the wind beneath my wings. 	8
10844	Helplessly Hoping	Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young	Jeff & Anna	06.29.96		Helplessly hoping, her harlequin hovers nearby. Awaiting a word, gasping at glimpses of gentle true spirit. He runs, wishing he could fly only to trip at the sound of good-bye. Wordlessly watching, he waits by the window and wonders at the empty place inside. Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams he worries. Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello? They are one person. They are two alone. They are three together. They are for each other. Stand by the stairway, you'll see something. Certain to tell you confusion has its cost. Love isn't lying, it's loose in a lady who lingers. Saying she is lost and choking on hello. They are one person. They are two alone. They are three together. They are for each other.	11
10847	Just The Way You Are	Bruno Mars	John & Jane	09.23.11		Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'. Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying. She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday. Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me. And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see. But every time she asks me "Do I look okay?" I say, "When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing just the way you are. And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while 'cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are." Yeah. Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me. Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy. She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday. Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change, if perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same. So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say, "When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing just the way you are. And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while 'cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are, the way you are, the way you are. Girl, you're amazing just the way you are." When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing just the way you are. And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while 'cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah.	7.5
10849	Candy	Paolo Nutini	Lesley & Frank	07.03.14		I was perched outside in the pouring rain, trying to make myself a sail. Then I'll float to you, my darling with the evening on my tail. Although not the most honest means of travel, it gets me there nonetheless. I'm a heartless man at worst, babe and a helpless one at best. Darling, I'll bathe your skin, I'll even wash your clothes. Just give me some candy before I go. Oh, darling, I'll kiss your eyes and lay you down on your rug. Just give me some candy after my hug. Oh, and I'm often false explaining but to her it plays out all the same. And although I'm left defeated, it gets held against my name. I know you got plenty to offer, baby but I guess I've taken quite enough. Well I'm some stain there on your bedsheet, you're my diamond in the rough. Darling, I'll bathe your skin, I'll even wash your clothes. Just give me some candy before I go. Oh, darling, I'll kiss your eyes and lay you down on your rug. Just give me some candy after my hug. I know that there're writings on the wall but, darling, I'll bathe your skin, I'll even wash your clothes. Just give me some candy before I go. Oh, darling, I'll kiss your eyes and lay you down on your rug. Just give me some candy after my hug. Oh and I'll be there waiting for you and I'll be there waiting for you. Oh I'll be there waiting for you. Oh I'll be there waiting for you. Oh I'll be there waiting for you. Oh I'll be there waiting for you. All the cutthroats and the jagged ends. All of them have got me waiting and waiting. All the cheap and the sugary philosophies have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting. All the angels and their halos, all of them have got me waiting and waiting. All the cutthroats and the jagged ends, all of them have got me waiting and waiting. All the cheap and the sugary philosophies have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting. All the angels and their halos, all they do is keep me waiting and waiting. I'll be there.	6.5
10851	Have you ever been in love	Celine Dion	Jim & Amy	04.30.05		In the morning light half awake and half asleep, have you ever laid there thinking was it all a dream? But you reach out and she's there every moment everywhere. Have you ever been in love? Have you ever felt how far a heart can fall. Have you ever stayed up waiting for a telephone call just to hear her say hello 'cause you miss each other so. Have you ever been in love? Have there been times to laugh and times you really want to cry. Finding reasons to believe her 'cause you'd die a little if she lied and when in times of doubt. Have you ever tried to work it out but still she leaves you wondering what it's all about and when she's far away. Have you ever felt the need to stray and tried and then discovered it just doesn't pay 'cause with her, you can be true and with her, you can be you. Have you ever been in love? Have there been times to laugh and times you really want to cry. Finding reasons to believe her 'cause you'd die a little if she lied and when in times of doubt. Have you ever tried to work it out but still she leaves you wondering what it's all about. And when the night comes down, can you call your house a home. Do you dream you're still together and wake up alone. Have you ever been in love the way that I'm in love. Have you ever been in love?	8
10854	Tangled up in You	Aaron Lewis	Tyson & Sunny	08.11.17		You're my world, the shelter from the rain. You're the pills, then take away my pain. You're the light that helps me find my way. You're the words when I have nothing to say. In this world where nothing else is true, here I am still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you, still tangled up in you. You're the fire that warms me when I'm cold. You're the hand I have to hold as I grow old. You're the shore when I am lost at sea. You're the only thing that I like about me. In this world where nothing else is true, here I am still tangled up in you, tangled up in you. How long has it been since this storyline began and I hope it never ends and goes like this forever. In this world where nothing else is true, here I am still tangled up in you, tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you.	10
10857	Si Nos Dejan	Luis Miguel	Carlos & Denisse	07.22.00		Si nos dejan nos vamos a querer toda la vida. Si nos dejan nos vamos a vivir a un mundo nuevo. Yo creo podemos ver el nuevo amanecer. De un nuevo día yo pienso que tú y yo. Podemos ser felices todavía. Si nos dejan buscamos un rincón cerca del cielo. Si nos dejan haremos con las nubes terciopelo. Y ahí juntitos los dos. Cerquita de Dios será lo que soñamos. Si nos dejan te llevo de la mano corazón. Y ahí nos vamos. Si nos dejan buscamos un rincón cerca del cielo. Si nos dejan haremos con las nubes terciopelo.

Si nos dejan.	11
10861	Angels	Robbie William	Darryl & Steph	11.07.98		I sit and wait. Does an angel contemplate my fate and do they know the places where we go when we're grey and old, 'cause I have been told that salvation lets their wings unfold. So when I'm lying in my bed, thoughts running through my head and I feel the love is dead. I'm loving angels instead and through it all she offers me protection. A lot of love and affection whether I'm right or wrong and down the waterfall, wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me. When I come to call she won't forsake me, I'm loving angels instead. When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street, I look above and I know I'll always be blessed with love. And as the feeling grows, she breathes flesh to my bones and when love is dead I'm loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection, a lot of love and affection whether I'm right or wrong and down the waterfall, wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me. When I come to call she won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead. And through it all she offers me protection, a lot of love and affection whether I'm right or wrong and down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me, I know that life won't break me. When I come to call she won't forsake me. I'm loving angels instead.	8

10864	Eu sei que vou te amar	Tom Jobim	Junior & Samara	15.11.02		Eu sei que vou te amar por toda a minha vida eu vou te amar. Em cada despedida eu vou te amar desesperadamente. Eu sei que vou te amar e cada verso meu sera. Pra te dizer que eu sei que vou te amar. Por toda minha vida. Eu sei que vou chorar a cada ausência tua eu vou chorar. Mas cada volta tua há de apagar o que esta ausência tua me causou. Eu sei que vou sofrer a eterna desventura de viver. A espera de viver ao lado teu por toda a minha vida.	13

10873	You were always on my mind	Elvis Presley				Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have and maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should have. If I made you feel second best, girl I'm sorry I was blind. You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind. And maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times. I guess I never told you I am so happy that you're mine. Little things I should have said and done. I just never took the time. You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind. Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died and give me. Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, I'll keep you satisfied, little things I should have said and done. I just never took the time. You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind). You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind).

10880	If you want		Ryan & Jenn	05.22.10		If you want me just to listen, call my name If you want me just to hold you, take my hand If you want me just to stay here, I’ll remain If you want me for no reason, I will understand I will wait for you as the daylight slips away I will wait for you in the quiet of the night I will wait for you, no time can steal my love I will wait for you if you want me to If you want me to discover, I will search for you If you want I’ll walk on water just to get to you If you want I’ll paint the sky a deeper blue For I will walk the extra mile just to be with you I will come for you as the daylight slips away I will come for you in the quiet of the night I will come for you, no time can steal my love I will come for you if you want me to I saw you standing there with a lost look in your eye Well I am standing here waiting for you to find I will wait for you as the daylight slips away I will wait for you in the quiet of the night I will wait for you, no time can steal my love I will wait for you if you want me to	9
10881	If	Bread	Arnie & Teri	06.05.76		If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you? The words will never show the "you" I've come to know. If a face could launch a thousand ships, then where am I to go? There's no one home but you, you're all that's left me too. And when my love, for life, is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me. If a man could be two places at one time, I'd be with you tomorrow and today, beside you all the way. If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die, I'd spend the end with you. And when the world was through, then one by one the stars would all go out. Then you and I would simply fly away.	11
10887	Give yourself to love	Kate Wolf	Teri & Walt	11.05.02		Kind friends all gathered 'round. There's something I would say that what brings us together here has blessed us all today. Love has made a circle that holds us all inside where strangers are as family, loneliness can't hide. You must give yourself to love if love is what you're after. Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter and give yourself to love, give yourself to love. I've walked these mountains in the rain and learned to love the wind. I've been up before the sunrise to watch the day begin. I've always knew I'd find you though I never did know how like sunshine on a cloudy day stand before me now. So give yourself to love if love is what you're after. Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter and give yourself to love, give yourself to love. Love is born in fire, it's planted like a seed. Love can't give you everything but it gives you what you need and love comes when you're ready, love comes when you're afraid. It'll be your greatest teacher, the best friend you have made. So give yourself to love if love is what you're after. Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter and give yourself to love, give yourself to love. Give yourself to love if love is what you're after. Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter and give yourself to love, give yourself to love.	8
10898	Never gonna let you go	Sergio Mendes	Ed & Christy	11.17.18		I was as wrong as I could be to let you get away from me. I'll regret that move for as long as I'm livin' but now that I've come to see the light, all I want to do is make things right so just say the word and tell me that I'm forgiven.

Let's talk about second chances wait and see, it's gonna be sweeter than it was before. I gave some then but now I intend to dedicate myself to giving more. This time you can be sure, I'm never gonna let you go. I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever gonna try and make up for all the times. I hurt you so, oh so if you'll just say. You want me too. 	8
10905	Can't let go	Calvin Richardson	Jerion & Ricki	04.04.20		In one million years, Mmmm I never thought I'd meet someone that's perfect. I never thought there was someone to make my mind go round in circles. I, I never knew there was a girl yeah yeah. A beach with jet-black sand in Jersey baby, but you are baby. Like my legs, I can't walk around without you (I can't even walk without you baby). Like my heart, the rhythm's bound to change without you. (The way it beats) Tappin' on my mind when I think about you girl. (I can't live without you baby naw) Holdin' on, I can't let go of you. Said I heard, that it never really rains in Arizona. That's what I heard and it came from the mouth of the one that I'm all in love with girl. Like the words of a preacher to the ears of a deacon, your eyes don't see the same when you're sleepin'. I'm so in love, in love, guess I'm goin' to Arizona. Like my legs, I can't walk around without you (I can't walk, I can't even talk without you baby).

Holdin' on, I can't let go of you. If I had to choose between money and you, girl. Give me sunshine and rain, pleasure or pain. I'd rather be holdin' yo' body. Like my legs, I can't walk around without you. Like my heart, the rhythm's bound to change without you (the way it beats). Tappin' on my mind when I think about you girl (when I think about you girl). Holdin' on, I can't let go of you (and I can't let go, I would never). Holdin' on, I can't let go of you (let you go baby). Holdin' on, I can't let go of you (you are my, my, my world baby). Holdin' on, I can't let go of you (and my heart, oh, my heart is broke without you lady). Holdin' on, I can't let go of you (stay with me, my lady, stay with me my lady).

10910	Collide	Howie Day	Jason & Heather	12.30.11		The dawn is breaking, a light shining through. You're barely waking and I'm tangled up in you. Yeah. I'm open you're closed, where I follow you'll go. I worry I won't see your face light up again. Even the best fall down sometimes, even the wrong words seem to rhyme. Out of the doubt that fills my mind, I somehow find you and I collide. I'm quiet you know you make a first impression. I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind. Even the best fall down sometimes, even the stars refuse to shine. Out of the back you fall in time, I somehow find you and I collide. Don't stop here, I've lost my place. I'm close behind. Even the best fall down sometimes, even the wrong words seem to rhyme. Out of the doubt that fills your mind, you finally find you and I collide. You finally find you and I collide. You finally find you and I collide.	10
10912	Forever	Kenny Loggins	Justin & Amanda	06.13.09		 And now while we're here alone and all is said and done, now I can let you know because of all you've shown. I've grown enough to tell you, you'll always be inside of me. How many roads have gone by so many words left unspoken. I needed to be by your side if only to hold you forever in my heart. Forever we will be and even when I'm gone. You'll be here in me forever. And once, I dreamed that you were gone. I cried out trying to find you. I begged the dream to fade away and please awaken me, but night took a hold of my heart and left me with no one to follow. The love that I lost to the dark I'll always remember forever in my heart. Forever we will be and even when I'm gone, you'll be here in me forever in my heart. Always thought I'd be, I'd be yours.  14
10914	Fade Into You	Mazzy Star	Tristan & Michelle	03.07.20		I want to hold the hand inside you. I want to take the breath that's true. I look to you and I see nothing. I look to you to see the truth. You live your life, you go in shadows. You'll come apart and you'll go black some kind of night into your darkness. Colors your eyes with what's not there. Fade into you strange you never knew. Fade into you. I think it's strange you never knew. A stranger's light comes on slowly, a stranger's heart without a home. You put your hands into your head and then smiles cover your heart fade into you. Strange you never knew, fade into you. I think it's strange you never knew.	12

10921	Before you	Jon McLaughlin	Troy & Auston	08.22.20		I feel like somebody else, I don't recognize myself. Staring into the mirror smiling ear to ear. It's funny how all this time I thought I was alive. Now I see things clearer smiling ear to ear. And now screaming at the top of my lungs, finally I found someone.

When you kiss me heaven sighs and though I close my eyes, I see la vie en rose. When you press me to your heart and in a world apart.

10927	Love Story	Taylor Swift	Genti & Erbli	11.16.91		We were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. See you make your way through the crowd and say, "Hello." Little did I know that you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." And I was crying on the staircase begging you, "Please don't go." And I said, "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." So, I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So, close your eyes, escape this town for a little while. Oh, oh. 'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter and my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." But you were everything to me, I was begging you, "Please don't go!" And I said, "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." Oh, oh, oh. I got tired of waiting, wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading, when I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said, "Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you, but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think." He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said, "Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone. I love you, and that's all I really know. I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'." Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.	6.5

I've been waiting on my own, too long and when you hold me like you do, it feels so right, oh now. I start to forget how my heart gets torn. When that hurt gets thrown feeling like you can't go on.

10937	3 Libras	A Perfect Circle	Chris & Sara	07.07.07		Threw you the obvious and you flew with it on your back. A name in your recollection, down, among a million same. Difficult not to feel a little bit, disappointed and passed over. When I look right through to see you naked, but oblivious. And you don't see me but I threw you the obvious just to see if there's more behind. The eyes of a fallen angel, eyes of a tragedy.Here, I am, expecting just a little bit. Too much from the wounded, but I see, see through it all. See through, see you. 'Cause I threw you the obvious to see what occurs behind. The eyes of a fallen angel, eyes of a tragedy, oh well. Oh well, apparently nothing, apparently nothing, at all. You don't, you don't, you don't see me. You don't, you don't, you don't see me. You don't, you don't, you don't see me. You don't, you don't, you don't see me. You don't see me, you don't, you don't, you don't see me, at all.	 10
10939	Beyond	Leon Bridges	Katy & Ray	09.28.13		Don't wanna get ahead of myself feeling things I've never felt. It's kinda hard for me to explain her personality and everything brings me to my knees, oh. She shines me up like gold on my arm. I wanna take it slow but it's so hard. I love to see her face in daylight. It's more than just our bodies at night but she's really tempting me, oh. Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in? I'm scared to death that she might be it, that the love is real, that the shoe might fit. She might just be my everything and beyond. Space and time in the afterlife, will she have my kids, will she be my wife. She might just be my everything and beyond. I wanna bring her 'round to meet ya. I think you'd like her kind demeanor. I know that Grandma would've loved her, like she was her own. She makes me feel at home, oh. Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in? I'm scared to death that she might be it, that the love is real, that the shoe might fit. She might just be my everything and beyond. Space and time in the afterlife, will she have my kids, will she be my wife. She might just be my everything and beyond. I give up, I'm in love crying, out to you. O me, o my, I can't explain she might just be my everything. O me, o my, I can't explain she might just be my everything. O me, o my, I can't explain, she might just be my everything. So do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in? I'm scared to death that she might be it, that the love is real, that the shoe might fit. She might just be my everything and beyond. Space and time in the afterlife will she have my kids, will she be my wife, she might just be my everything and beyond, yeah. She might just be mine.  6
10945	Grow Old	Florida Georgia Line	Rob & Sam	09.21.19		Tell me that you love me. Say "We'll always work it out". I know it's kinda scary but it's only temporary doubt. I've done a lot of stupid things but promise that you're gonna stay long enough to grow old with me. We're gonna see the good times love each other through the bad. It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads so let my shoulder hold your tears. Walk beside me through the years. Baby let's see, where this love could lead. Let's hold hands on your favorite beach, fix up a house that we found in the city limits. Tangled up in a satin sheet and get a little loud when we've had to much to drink and learn to love from a church pew. Laugh about all the times we counted pennies, buy some land with a good view to start a family. Baby grow old with me, it's gonna take a little time we'll have to work at it everyday. We're gonna lose a lot of sleep and learn to eat out of a microwave. You know we'll probably never have it all but that's part of building up the walls strong enough to stand up through the rain. We'll make some love on your favorite beach and at the house that we found in the city limits. Talk our babies through the bad dreams. When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink. Book a church when she finds a groom, laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies. Give them land with a good view to start a family and baby you know we might take a turn down a back road, maybe go where the wind blows baby but end up right where we were meant to be. Back and forth on a porch swing, hard not to smile thinking how it don't get much better. Our babies, babies turning 18. What a family, baby grow old with me, baby grow old with me, baby grow old with me. Tell me that you love me, say "we'll always work it out".	6.5
10950	Never my love	The Association	Todd & Karen	07.08.89		You ask me if there'll come a time when I grow tired of you. Never my love, never my love. You wonder if this heart of mine will lose its desire for you. Never my love, never my love. What makes you think love will end when you know that my whole life depends on you. Never my love, never my love. You say you fear I'll change my mind and I won't require you. Never my love, never my love. How can you think love will end when I've asked you to spend your whole life with me.	13

10995	 Wind Beneath My Wings	Gary Morris	 Robb & Renee	05.26.90		It must have been cold there in my shadow, to never have sunlight on your face. You've been content to let me shine. You always walked a step behind. I was the one with all the glory while you were the one with all the strength. Only a face without a name, I never once heard you complain. Did you ever know that you're my hero? And everything I'd like to be? I can fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings. It might have appeared to go unnoticed, but I've got it all here in my heart. I want you to know, I know the truth, I would be nothing without you. Did you ever know that you're my hero? And everything I'd like to be? I can fly higher than an eagle 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings. You are the wind beneath my wings.	11

No one, no one, no one can get in the way of what I'm feeling. No one, no one, no one can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you. Can get in the way of what I feel for you. When the rain is pouring down and my heart is hurting, you will always be around. This I know for certain, you and me together through the days and nights.

11214	I Choose You	Andy Grammer	Billy & Christie	09.14.19		When we're born into this world, we don't really get to say. Little boys and little girls handed the brand new families. There comes a time in life when we finally get to choose. And I choose you, I choose you. We can't give our two cents of how tall we want to be. We don't get an opinion on our ethnicity. But the one we spend our life with, that we get to choose. And I choose, I choose you. I choose you, to be by my side. I choose you, to hold me at night. It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right. I choose you, I choose you. Everybody has one - a choice they get to make. Half human half heaven that decides the family tree. Now we all pick the branches that then becomes the roots. I choose you, I choose you. I choose you, to be by my side. I choose you, to hold me at night. It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right. I choose you, I choose you. I was worried I would not know what to do If I was in these shoes. Standing here, it's clearer than the sky is blue that I choose you, I choose you. With so little we control, thank God it's in the rules. We get to choose, and I choose you. I choose you, to be by my side. I choose you, to hold me at night. It's the biggest decision I'm about to get right. I choose you, I choose you.	8
11215	This Year's Love	David Gray	Sam & Rachael	03.07.20		This year's love had better last. Heaven knows it's high time. I've been waiting on my own too long, and when you hold me like you do, it feels so right. Oh, now I start to forget how my heart gets torn.

Oh, now if ya love me got to know for sure 'cause it takes something more this time than sweet, sweet lies. Oh, now before I open up my arms and fall losing all control, every dream inside my soul.

This year's love it better last. This year's love it better last. OOh, ah yeah, this year's love it better last.	9
11217	Time After Time	Placido Domingo	Jack & Danielle	08.16.97		Time after time, I tell myself that I'm so lucky to be loving you. So lucky to be the one you run to see in the evening when the day is through. I only know what I know the passing years will show. You've kept my love so young, so new. And time after time, you'll hear me say that I'm so lucky to be loving you. 	17
11220	You Had Me at Hello	Jerry Maguire	Rosemary & Paul	16.02.20		One word, that's all you said. Something in your voice called me, turned my head. Your smile, just captured me. You were in my future as far as I could see. And I don't know how it happens, but it happens still. You asked me if I love you, if I always will. Well you had me from hello, I felt love start to grow. The moment that I looked into your eyes, you won me. It was over from the start, you completely stole my heart. And now you won't let go. I never even had a chance you know, you had me from hello. Inside I built a wall, so high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall. One touch, you brought it down. The bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground. And I swore to me I wasn't going to love again. The last time was the last time I'd let someone in. But you had me from hello, I felt love start to grow. The moment that I looked into your eyes you won me. It was over from the start you completely stole my heart. And now you won't let go. I never even had a chance you know. You had me from hello. That's all you said. Something in your voice calls me, turns my head. You had me from hello, you had me from hello. Girl, I've loved you from hello.	8
11222	If I Could Only Fly	Blaze Foley	I Love You Heart and Soul			I almost felt you touching me just now. I wish I knew which way to turn and go. I feel so good and then I feel so bad. I wonder what I ought to do. If I could only fly, if I could only fly I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you. But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run. Another sinking sun and one more lonely night. The wind keeps blowing, somewhere, everyday. Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way just dismal thinking on a dismal day,  and sad songs for us to bare. If I could only fly, if we could only fly, if we could only fly, there'd be no more lonely nights. You know, sometimes, I write happy songs, then some little thing goes wrong. I wish they all could make you smile. Coming home soon and I wanna stay. Maybe we can, somehow, get away. I wish you could come with me when I go again. If I could only fly, if I could only fly, I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you. But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run. Another sinking sun and one more lonely night.	9
11002	Love Changes Everything	Andrew Lloyd Webber	Carol & Kevin	12.30.95		Love, love changes everything, hands and faces, earth and sky. Love, love changes everything, how you live and how you die. Love, can make the summer fly or a night seem like a lifetime. Yes love, love changes everything. Now I tremble at your name, nothing in the world will ever be the same. Love, love changes everything, days are longer, words mean more. Love, love changes everything, pain is deeper, than before. Love, will turn your world around and that world will last forever. Yes, love, love changes everything, brings you glory, brings you shame. Nothing in the world will ever be the same. Off into the world we go planning futures, shaping years. Love bursts in and suddenly all our wisdom disappears.Love, makes fools of everyone. All the rules we make are broken. Yes, love, love changes everyone, live or perish, in its flame. Love will never ever let you be the same. Love will never ever let you be the same.	9
11008	Soulshine	The Allman Brothers	Joey & Jessica	02.22.14		When you can't find the light that guides you through a cloudy day. When the stars ain't shining bright, you feel like you've lost you're way. When the candle light of home burns so very far away, well, you got to let your soul shine just like my daddy used to say. He used to say soulshine, it's better than sunshine, it's better than moonshine damn sure better than rain. Hey now people, don't mind, we all get this way sometime. Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day. I grew up thinking that I had it made. Gonna make it on my own, life can take the strongest man, make him feel so alone. Now sometimes I feel a cold wind blowing through my aching bones. I think back to what my daddy said. He said, "Boy, there is darkness before the dawn." Let your soul shine, it's better than sunshine, it's better than moonshine, damn sure better than rain. Yeah, now people don't mind, we all get this way sometimes. Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day. Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness like a woman has robbed him of his very soul. A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this. And when your world seems cold, you got to let your spirit take control. Talking 'bout soulshine, it's better than sunshine, it's better than moonshine, damn sure better than rain. Lord, now people don't mind, we all get this way sometimes. Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day. Oh, it's better than sunshine, it's better than moonshine, damn sure better than rain. Yeah, now people don't mind, we all feel this way sometimes. Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.	5

11023	Blackbird	The Beatles	Dan & Kim	07.01.17		Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise. Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free. Black bird fly, black bird fly into the light of the dark black night. Black bird fly, black bird fly into the light of the dark black night. Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise.

11024	Love at First Sight	Styx	Scott & Laura	10.09.99		Driving past your house again, I feel the same way I did then. I get weak, just thinking about you. It all began so easily, a look from you, a glance from me then our eyes met like thunder & lightning. You and I, strangers lost in a moment. Eye to eye, we were caught unaware of the passion inside us. Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening. No, not to someone like me. Love at first sight, so rare, and so exciting. I only hope this love we found can last. I'm not a man who acts this way but lately I can't concentrate and I don't sleep, just dreaming about you. I try to reach you on the phone but voices there say you're not home and my heart aches, thinking I've lost you. One more time, seeing your face in the moonlight. One more chance to be caught unaware of this passion inside us. Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening. No, not to someone like me. Love at first sight, it's hard to keep your balance moving past the point of no return. If you need some time to understand your feelings, if you need some time away, I'll be waiting for you with open arms my love. All that night we made love in the moonlight. Eye to eye, we were so unaware of the passion inside us. Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening. No, not to someone like me. Love at first sight, so rare, and so exciting. I only hope this love we found can last.	7
11025	I Just Called to Say I Love You	Stevie Wonder	Gaz & Jen	12.06.87		No New Year's Day to celebrate. No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away. No first of spring, no song to sing. In fact here's just another ordinary day. No April rain. No flowers bloom. No wedding Saturday within the month of June. But what it is, is something true. Made up of these three words that I must say to you. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care. I just called to say I love you and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. No summer's high. No warm July. No harvest moon to light one tender August night. No autumn breeze. No falling leaves. Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. No Libra sun. No Halloween. No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring. But what it is, though old so new. To fill your heart like no three words could ever do. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care, I do. I just called to say I love you and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Can we sing it one more time please. I just called to say I love you (I just called to say, I just called to say I love you). I just called to say how much I care, I do (I just called to say, I just called to say I do).

For the first time I'm in love, for the last time. My love was like a lyric with no melody and words are only words if there's no poetry. Now, I've found my rhyme. For the first time I'm in love, for the last time. So many bridges burned without a lesson learned. I thought that I had earned this life alone. But through God's saving grace and the beauty of your face, my heart has found a place to call my own. I never thought forever'd ever be for me. I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be but now both are mine. For the first time I'm in love, for the last time. So many bridges burned without a lesson learned.

11232	Just Because	Anita Baker	Shawn & Beth	03.11.89		When I think about how much I'm loving you, no limitations, no set of regimented rules. I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life and the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice. This must be, sweet fatal attraction, my life-long date with destiny. Love this strong, it just brings out the passion I never knew was here in me. I love you just because, I love you just because, just because I do, my darlin'. Emotions more than words can help me say I love you, baby, just because you're you, just because you're you. You're a diamond in my mind, a treasure found, a precious gem to me. You're so nice to have around, I'm so glad I took the path that led to this. And it's amazin' loving you, I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do. I don't know, there ain't no explanation of why I'm sharin' love at last this way. I won't try to work out all my reasons. I'II use these words to simply say. I love you just because, I love you just because, just because I do, my darlin'. Emotions more than words can help me say I love you, baby, just because you're you. I love you just because, I love you just because, just because I do, my darlin'. Emotions more than words can help me say I love you, baby. Could it be that there's more to this than meets the eye, maybe that's the reason why. All I know is when I'm in your arms it feels all right. I'II hold you tight and I come alive. I love you just because, I love you just because, just because I do, my darlin'. Emotions more than words can help me say I love you, baby, just because you're you.	7
11235	This Love is True	NRBQ	Lisa & Roddy	Updated Lyrics		A love that's all to us, a love we give and trust, a love that mean so much, this love is true, Sometimes at night when the sky want to cry, you come to me and the clouds are seem to pass me by. Sometimes it's hard to find a true and trusting kind, a love like your and mine. This love is true all through our lives. There were dreams come and gone but our love survives. It's a love that will go and on and when we're all alone and when the day is through, these words I say to you. This love is true and ever has a tender touch. Meant so much and I know our love is true, will last our whole life through. And there's one thing i know, my heart it tells me so. I whisper soft and low, this love is true. And when we're all alone and when the day is through, these words I say to you, this love is true.	10
11237	Way of the World	Tina Turner	Marilyn & Steven	04.03.93		Baby I need a hand to hold tonight and one bright star to remind me how dear is this life. Baby I've never known anyone like you. There's something very special about you, I can't imagine living without you. It's the way of the world and it's motion and no ocean can keep us apart. When the moment is right and you're holding me tight, you capture the beat of my heart. In my heart there's a fire that's burning and there isn't a thing I can do. I'm resigned to the fact that there's no turning back and I'll never regret loving you. Baby I will go anywhere you lead as long as you're there beside me. Baby that's all I need. Hold me hold me and never let me go. I'm always gonna care about you, I never want to be without you. It's the way of the world and it's motion and no ocean can keep us apart. When the moment is right and you're holding me tight, you capture the beat of my heart. In my heart there's a fire that's burning and there isn't a thing I can do.

11239	Gotta Be Somebody	Nickleback	Roberts	08.16.12		This time, I wonder what it feels like to find the one in this life, the one we all dream of. But dreams just aren't enough so I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling. The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen. So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end. Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with. Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares, someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me like that cause nobody wants to do it on their own. And everyone wants to know they're not alone, there's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight and dammit this feels too right, it's just like déja vu, me standing here with you. So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end? Is it that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with? Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares, someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me like that cause nobody wants to do it on their own. And everyone wants to know they're not alone, there's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. You can't give up, (when you're looking for) a diamond in the rough (cause you never know). When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on) cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on. Cause nobody wants to be the last one there and everyone wants to feel like someone cares, smeone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me, oh.  Nobody wants to do it on their own and everyone wants to know they're not alone. There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there, nobody wants to be the last one there cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares. There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there.	5
11245	God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You	NSYNC	Matthew & Jaime	04.17.99		Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real? How can I put into words what I feel? My life was complete, I thought I was whole. Why do I feel like I'm losing control? I never thought that love could feel like this and you've changed my world with just one kiss. How can it be that right here with me there's an angel? It's a miracle. Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep. When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true. God must have spent a little more time on you. In all of creation, all things great and small, you are the one that surpasses them all. More precious than any diamond or pearl. They broke the mold when you came in this world. And I'm trying hard to figure out just how I ever did without the warmth of your smile. The heart of a child that's deep inside leaves me purified. Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep. When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, God must have spent a little more time on you. Never thought that love could feel like this and you changed my world with just one kiss. How can it be that right here with me there's an angel? It's a miracle. Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.

11246	Somebody	Depeche Mode	Dana & Brent	02.17.96		I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life, share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details. Someone who'll stand by my side and give me support and in return, she'll get my support. She will listen to me when I want to speak about the world we live in and life in general. Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted. She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted to my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree but at the end of it all, she will understand me. I want somebody who cares for me passionately with every thought and with every breath. Someone who'll help me see things in a different light. All the things I detest I will almost like. I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings. I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things but when I'm asleep I want somebody who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly though things like this make me sick. In a case like this, I'll get away with it.	9
11247	This is Me	Keala Settle, The Greatest Showman	Amerie Weddle	10.05.19		I'm not a stranger to the dark. Hide away, they say 'cause we don't want your broken parts. I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars. Run away, they say nNo one will love you as you are. But I won't let them break me down to dust. I know that there's a place for us, for we are glorious. When the sharpest words wanna cut me down, I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out. I am brave, I am bruised, I am who I'm meant to be, this is me. Look out 'cause here I come and I'm marching on to the beat I drum. I'm not scared to be seen, I make no apologies, this is me. Another round of bullets hits my skin. Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in. We are bursting through the barricades and reaching for the sun (we are warriors), yeah, that's what we've become. Won't let them break me down to dust, I know that there's a place for us for we are glorious. When the sharpest words wanna cut me down, gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out. I am brave, I am bruised, I am who I'm meant to be, this is me. Look out 'cause here I come and I'm marching on to the beat I drum. I'm not scared to be seen, I make no apologies, this is me.

11256	Little Things	One Direction	Dave & Lisa	06.08.19		Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me but bear this in mind, it was meant to be. And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks and it all makes sense to me. I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile. You've never loved your stomach or your thighs, the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine but I'll love them endlessly. I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth. But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to. I'm in love with you and all these little things. You can't go to bed without a cup of tea and maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep. And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep though it makes no sense to me. I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape. You never want to know how much you weigh. You still have to squeeze into your jeans but you're perfect to me. I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth. But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to. I'm in love with you and all these little things. You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you. And you'll never treat yourself right darlin' but I want you to. If I let you know I'm here for you, maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh. I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth. 'Cause it's you, oh, it's you, it's you they add up to. And I'm in love with you and all these little things. I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth. But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to. I'm in love with you and all your little things.	8
11258	Prom Song	Depswa	Garrett & Jessica	08.26.06		They're more than just words, they're colors to paint my feelings for you. And I know how, that there's no way to show you, just how much I care. And I feel it oh so deep within me and I know that there's so much left to share. All the times you're away, feels just like eternity. As the moments that we had, had to end. The strokes of the brush brings me closer to your touch. Through the hues we'll find a way to follow, I know we will. And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean.Aand the hues they will change from day to day. But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever on this Canvas of our lives that we create (and our love will last forever). And I know that always, I saw to try to display just how precious that you are to the world. Cause I know with just a touch you can show me oh so much that there's more to this life than what we see. The strokes of the brush brings me closer to your touch. Through the hues we'll find a way to follow, I know we will. And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean.Aand the hues they will change from day to day. But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever on this Canvas of our lives that we create (and our love will last forever). Colors may fade, turning vibrant to grey. But one thing's unchanged, the picture is still the same. And through the days and nights the vision lives on forever. And through a masterpiece of love me made together. We've given all we can, I know the world will understand, the picture is of you, and me. And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean.Aand the hues they will change from day to day. But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever on this Canvas of our lives that we create (and our love will last forever).	7

11057	Tennessee Love	Yelawolf	Marcus & Shalyn	02.15.20		I must be Jim Morrison to get a motherfucking girl like you. Don't know what I did in my past life but it must have been something cool. 'Cause I'm a whiskey-drinkin', fight-provoking, cigarette-smoking dude. I got a problem with my attitude, it's hard for me to keep cool. But when I look at you, I see me a reflection of a real soul. So pardon me if I may seem loose and out of control. It ain't the drink talkin', it's me talking. Fuck if everyone knows, you my girl and that's that. So hop on the back of this bike and roll, let's roll now. I never let someone straight up disrespect you. I never let someone call you out your name. I'll always be the one that runs up to protect you 'cause I know if I was down you'd come and do the same. So, let's pack it up and move our life to Nashville. Build a studio in the house and do our thing and I'll take you out and we'll go honky-tonkin'. Get drunk and fall in Tennessee love, Tennessee love. Fall in Tennessee love, fall in tennessee love, fall in Tennessee love. Can't you see that my hands are shaking? Withdrawals from alcohol. Ain't no use in us faking but it's our life. Ain't it, baby?

They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance, and I have never seen that dress you're wearing or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes, I have been blind. The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek. There's nobody here, it's just you and me. It's where I want to be but I hardly know this beauty by my side. I'll never forget the way you look tonight. I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight. I've never seen you shine so bright, you were amazing.

The lady in red, the lady in red, the lady in red, my lady in red. I love you.	7
11070	What if I was Nothing	All That Remains	Jason & Heaven	07.25.08		Just let it go, don't want to argue anymore. I can't be sure I know just what we're fighting for. I know you're scared and that you're thinking I may go. I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving. And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray. Just remember this one question. What if I was nothing? What if this is true? What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you? So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do? I told you that I love you, girl, I'm nothing without you. I know it's hard, it seems we've worked at this so long. It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong. I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go and I believe it, I believe it. And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray, just remember this one question: What if I was nothing? What if this is true? What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you?

You're lovely with your smile, so warm and your cheeks so soft. There is nothing for me but to love you and the way you look tonight. With each word your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart. Lovely, never ever change. Keep that breathless charm, won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you just the way you look tonight.

11079	Nothing Compares 2U	Chris Cornell	John & Dawna	2		It's been seven hours and fifteen days since you took your love away. I go out every night and sleep all day since you took your love away. Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want, I can see whomever I choose, I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant but nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues. 'Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you. It's been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without a song, nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling, tell me, baby, where did I go wrong. I could put my arms around every boy I see but they'd only remind me of you. I went to the doctor and guess what he told me? Guess what he told me? He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do." But he's a fool 'cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you. All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard, all died when you went away. I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard but I'm willing to give it another try. Nothing compares, nothing compares to you. Nothing compares, nothing compares to you. Nothing compares, nothing compares to you.	9
11082	Shallow	Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga	Jason & Kristy	02.01.20		Tell me something girl, are you happy in this modern world or do you need more? Is there something else you're searching for? I'm falling. In all the good times I find myself longing for change and in the bad times I fear myself. Tell me something boy, aren't you tired trying to fill that void or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? I'm falling. In all the good times I find myself longing for change and in the bad times I fear myself. I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in. I'll never meet the ground. Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us. We're far from the shallow now. In the shallow, we're far from the shallow now. I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in. I'll never meet the ground. Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us. We're far from the shallow now. In the shallow, we're far from the shallow now.	10
11083	Whistle for the Choir	Fraterllis	Scott & Stacy	03.11.09		Well it's a big big city and it's always the same. Can never be too pretty tell me your name. Is it out of line if I was to be bold to say "Would you be mine"? Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen. I know I may be on a downer I'm still ready to dream. Though it's 3 o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk. So if you're lonely why'd you say you're not lonely. Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so. It's just like you to come and go and know me. No, you don't even know me. You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye. A girl like you's just irresistible. Well it's a big, big city and the lights are all out. But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out. And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces and my head's a mess. And it's 4 in the morning, and I'm walking along beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong. And it's you, woo hoo, that's got me going crazy for the things you do. So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me. But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk. I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry and only a girl like you could be lonely. And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same, a boy like me's just irresistible. So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely? Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so. It's just like you to come and go and know me no, you don't even know me. You're so sweet to try oh my, you caught my eye, a girl like you's just irresistible.	6

I know you love me and soon you'll see you were meant for me, and I was meant for you. I called my momma, she was out for a walk. Consoled a cup of coffee, but it didn't want to talk. So I pick up the paper, it was more bad news more hearts being broken or people being used. Put on my coat in the pouring rain. I saw a movie, it just was wasn't the same 'cause it was happy and I was sad. It made me miss you, oh, so bad. Dreams last for so long, even after you're gone. I know you love me and soon you'll see you were meant for me, and I was meant for you. I go about my business I'm doin' fine. Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line. Same old stort, not much to say. Hearts are broken, everyday. I brush my teeth and put the cap back on. I know you hate it when I leave the light on. I pick up a book, turn the sheets down take a deep breath and a good look around. Put on my p.j's and hop into bed. I'm half alive, but I feel mostly dead. I try to tell myself it'll be alright, I just shouldn't think anymore tonight. Dreams last for so long, even after you're gone. I know you love me and soon I know you'll see you were meant for me, and I was meant for you. Yeah, you were meant for me and I was meant for you.	5

So lead me through tonight, but please turn out the light 'cause I'm lost every time I look at you. And in the morning when you go, wake me gently so I'll know that loving you was not a dream. And whisper softly what it means to be with me, then every moment we're apart will be a lifetime to my heart. I close my eyes the moment I surrender to you.

11438	Kiss Me 	Sixpence None The Richer	Matthew & Keli	07.19.03		Kiss me out of the bearded barley. Nightly, beside the green, green grass. Swing, swing, swing the spinning step, you wear those shoes and I will wear that dress. Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight. Lead me out on the moonlit floor. Lift your open hand, strike up the band and make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me. Kiss me down by the broken tree house. Swing me upon its hanging tire. Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat, we'll take the trail marked on your father's map. Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight. Lead me out on the moonlit floor, lift your open hand, strike up the band and make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me. Kiss me beneath the milky twilight, Lead me out on the moonlit floor. Lift your open hand, strike up the band and make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.	10
11440	Sunday Morning	Ani DiFranco	Brian & Faye	08.05.00		Search your profile for a translation. I study the conversation like a map 'cause I know there is strength in the differences between us, and I know there is comfort where we overlap. Come here, stand in front of the light. Stand still so I can see your silhouette. I hope you have got all night 'cause I'm not done looking. No, I'm not done looking yet. Each one of us wants a piece of the action. You can hear it in what we say. You can see it in what we do. We negotiate with chaos for some sense of satisfaction. If you won't give it to me at least, give me a better view. Come here, stand in front of the light. Stand still so I can see your silhouette. I hope you have got all night 'cause I'm not done looking. No, I'm not done looking yet. I build each one of my songs out of glass so you can see me inside of them. I suppose or you could just leave the image of me in the background, I guess. And watch your own reflection superimposed. I build each one of my days out of hope and I give that hope your name. And I don't know you that well but it don't take much to tell. Either you don't have the balls or you don't feel the same. Come here, stand in front of the light. Stand still so I can see your silhouette. I hope you have got all night 'cause I'm not done looking. No, I'm not done looking yet. I search your profile for a translation. I study the conversation like a map 'cause I know there is strength in the differences between us, and I know there is comfort where we overlap.	5

11466	Galileo	Josh Groban	Dave & Debbie	04.26.15		Galileo fell in love as a Galilean would and he wondered, what in Heaven? Who invented such a joy? But the question got the better of his scientific mind, and to his blind and dying days he looked up high and often sighed, and sometimes cried. Who puts the rainbow in the sky? Who lights the stars at night? Who dreamt up someone so divine? Someone like you and made them mine? Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then. But just remember the alternatives for I remember when I was lonely and unhappy, and my lips were cold as ice, but you kissed me and good Heavens now I'm here in paradise. So if I'm ever not kissing you or looking in your eyes, I won't be blind and I won't cry. I'll look up high and gladly sigh. And thank the guy who puts the rainbow in the sky, who lights the stars at night, who dreamt up someone so divine. Someone like you and made them mine. Someone like you and made them mine.	9

I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times. A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind, and it hit me. It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear. Some days you just breath in just try to break even. Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest, sometimes it's just beatin'. Some days you just forget what all you've been given. Some days you just get back, and some days you're just alive. Some days you're livin'. Some days you're livin'. I went back in and fired the coffee up. She walked in the kitchen like she always does, in my t-shirt and it killed me, and I kissed her like it was the first time. She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind, I said, "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough." Some days you just breath in just try to break even. Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest, sometimes it's just beatin'. Some days you just forget what all you've been given. Some days you just get back, and some days you're just alive. Some days you're livin'. Like you never die. Blue's a little bluer up in the sky. You're high's a little high. You feel that fire you've been missing. Some days you're living it's a beautiful world, sometimes I don't see so clear. Some days you start singin' and you don't need a reason. Sometimes the world's just right your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'. Got a heart full of grateful for all you've been given. Some days you just get by. Yeah, some days you're just alive. Some days you're livin'. Some days you're livin', yeah, yeah. Livin' like you'll never die. Blue's a little bluer up in the sky. You're high's a little high. You feel that fire you've been missin'. Some days you're living. Some days you're living.	6.5

Don't let your life pass you by, weep not for the memories. I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose. Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose.

You can tell the sun in his jealous sky when we walked in fields of gold. So she took her love for to gaze awhile among the fields of barley.

11755	Perhaps Love	John Denver	Kenny & JoAnn	03.18.89		Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm. It exists to give you comfort, it is there to keep you warm. And in those times of trouble, when you are most alone, the memory of love will bring you home. Perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door. It invites you to come closer, it wants to show you more. And even if you lose yourself and don't know what to do, the memory of love will see you through. Oh, love to some is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel, for some a way of living, for some a way to feel. And some say love is holding on and some say letting go and some say love is everything and some say they don't know. Perhaps love is like the ocean, full of conflict, full of pain, like a fire when it's cold outside or thunder when it rains. If I should live forever and all my dreams come true, my memories of love will be of you.

Can I hold you closer to me and not feel you goin' through me? Split the second that I never think of you, oh how impossible. Can the ocean keep from rushin' to the shore, it's just impossible. If I had you could I ever want for more, it's just impossible. And tomorrow should ya ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it.

Step out of the driving rain, maybe run from the darkness in the night. Singing ha ah la la la de day. Ah da da da de day. Ah la la de day. Sweet the sin bitter than taste in my mouth, I see seven towers but I only see one way out. You got to cry without weeping talk without speaking, scream without raising your voice. You know I took the poison from the poison stream then I floated out of here. Singing ha la la la de day. Ha la la la de day. Ha la la de day. She runs through the streets with eyes painted red, under a black belly of cloud in the rain. In through a doorway she brings me white gold and pearls stolen from the sea. She is raging. She is raging and the storm blows up in her eyes. She will suffer the needle chill. She's running to stand still.	10

More than a woman, more than a woman to me. More than a woman, oh, oh, oh. There are stories, old and true, of people so in love like you and me. And I can see myself let history repeat itself.

And if I lose your love I know I would die. Oh say you'll always be my baby. We can make it shine, we can take forever, just a minute at a time. More than a woman, more than a woman to me. More than a woman, more than a woman to me. More than a woman, oh, oh, oh.	8.5

You are here, so am I. Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view and I only have eyes for you.	15

11930	Fireflies	Owl City	Wes & Aerynn Wilson	12.13.19		You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies lit up the world as I fell asleep. 'Cause they fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere. You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare. I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'cause everything is never as it seems. 'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs as they tried to teach me how to dance. A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed, a disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread). I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep). Leave my door open just a crack, please take me away from here. 'Cause I feel like such an insomniac, please take me away from here. Why do I tire of counting sheep, please take me away from here. When I'm far too tired to fall asleep to ten million fireflies. I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes, I got misty eyes as they said farewell (said farewell). But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre 'cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar). I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep). I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep).	7

11938	Just Say Yeah	Jackson Browne	Joe & Lori			I wanted to be somebody, you see. When you're feeling good, I started looking for your little MG in my neighborhood. I started feeling kind of funny and free when you were around. And I began to cook up a plan to take you out of town, not really dating. We were relating, and we were friends. It's hard to say where the relating leaves off and where loves begins. A friend will tell you all kinds of stuff that a lover won't. And you would think you would see love coming, but of course, you don't. I want to hold you don't want to mold you into someone else. I never could have invented you or written you so well. I never met another woman who possessed your particular charms. I want to be that man who will see that you never come to harm. Must have been you I dreamed of, yeah,  that was you all right. You were the laughter I was listening to standing in the light. You were the lover in the sunrise who had begun to slip away. Though I was just a kid I must have known you'd be real someday. I want to know you. I want to show you that you're not alone. You've been the only thing steadying me, and I guess we've both known. Maybe you haven't been that ready to see that I could take you there. Well,  that was then, but this is when I need to hear you say, yeah. Baby, just say, yeah.	8

Field and forest, vale and mountain, flow'ry meadow, flashing sea, chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in Thee. Thou art giving and forgiving ever blessing, ever blest well-spring of the joy of living, ocean-depth of happy rest. Thou the Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are thine. Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the Joy Divine. Mortals join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began. Father-love is reigning o'er us, brother-love binds man to man.

11957	On My Way To You	Barbra Streisand	Kevin & Tonni	06.30.90		So often, as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting the words I've or should have said like scenes that need rewriting. The smiles I never answered, doors perhaps I should have opened, songs forgotten in the morning. I relive the roles I've played, the tears I may have squandered. The many pipers I have paid along the roads I've wandered. Yet, all the time, I knew it. Love was somewhere out there waiting. Though I may regret a kiss or two if I had changed a single day, what went amiss or went astray, I may have never found my way to you. If I had changed a single day what went amiss or went astray, I may have never found my way to you. I wouldn't change a thing that happened on my way to you.	11

My love is strong, with you there is no wrong, together we shall go until we die. My, my, my. An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look, see. And so today my world—it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles. Thanks to you, it will be done for you to me are the only one. Happiness, no more be sad. Happiness, I'm glad.

If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you. Mountains crumble to the sea. There will still be you and me.	10
11965	I Believe In You	Don Williams	Joe & Carol	10.03.87		I don't believe in superstars. Organic food and foreign cars. I don't believe the price of gold. The certainty of growing old, that right is right and left is wrong. That north and south can't get along. That east is east and west is west and being first is always best. But I believe in love, I believe in babies. I believe in mom and dad, and I believe in you. Well I don't believe that heaven waits for only those who congregate. I like to think of God as love. He's down below, he's up above. He's watching people everywhere. He knows who does and doesn't care and I'm an ordinary man. Sometimes I wonder who I am but I believe in love, I believe in music. I believe in magic and I believe in you. I know with all my certainty what's goin' with you and me is a good thing. It's true, I believe in you. I don't believe virginity is as common as it used to be. In working days and sleeping nights, that black is black and white is white. That Superman and Robin Hood are still alive in Hollywood. That gasoline's in short supply. The rising cost of getting by but I believe in love, I believe in old folks. I believe in children I believe in you. I believe in love I believe in babies. I believe in mom and dad and I believe in you.	8

11968	All That I Am	Rob Thomas	David & Stephany	07.19.11		I am the one-winged bird for flying, sinking quickly to the ground. See your faith in me subsiding, see you prime for giving in. I give you all that I am. I am the sound of love's arriving, echoed softly on the sand. Lay your head upon my shoulder, lay your hand within my hand. I give you all that I am, and I breathe where you breathe. Let me stand where you stand with all that I am. I am the white dove for a soldier, ever marching as to war. I would give my life to save you. I stand guarding at your door. I give you all that I am. I am the one-winged bird for flying, sinking quickly to the ground. I am the blind man for a watchdog. I am prime for giving in, I'll show you all that I am, and I breathe so you breathe. Let me stand, so you'll stand with all that I am.	11

I tried to carry you and make you whole, but it was never enough. I must go. And who is gonna save you when I'm gone? And who'll watch over you when I'm gone?

And who is gonna save you when I'm gone? And who'll watch over you? And I will give you strength when you're not strong. Who'll watch over you when I'm gone away? Snow is on the ground winters come. You long to hear my voice, but I'm long gone.	10

Say you'll remember. Oh, baby, say you'll remember. Oh, baby, ooh. I will love you 'til the end of time. You went out every night. And baby, that's alright, I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side. 'Cause I'mma ride or die whether you fail or fly. Well, shit, at least you tried. But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died. I told you I wanted more, but that's not what I had in mind. I just want it like before. We were dancing all night, then they took you away, stole you out of my life. You just need to remember. I will love you 'til the end of time. I would wait a million years. Promise, you'll remember that you're mine. Baby, can you see through the tears? Love you more than those bitches before. Say you'll remember. Oh baby, say you'll remember. Oh, baby, ooh. I will love you 'til the end of time.	6
11985	Forever My Love	Carly Simon	Tom & Carol	07.17.83		Words of love softly spoken like clouds above, drift away. What shall I say? To let you know the way I feel. Should I cry out loud that love is real? Or simply reveal? Forever my love. Time alone will tell us. Lovers born in May may grow bitter and jealous, faded and gray. What shall I say? It's not another lovers game. It doesn't seen to have a name. It changes and remains the same. Forever my love, my love. Yesterday's projection will never really know, but tomorrow's recollection will surely know. It was so, between us. Ain't no other way time has seen us day after day. What shall I say? That isn't in the way I act that will carry through the years intact. I'm lookin' forward to lookin' back from further in down the track, together in fact. Forever my love, my love.	11
11986	How Deep Is Your Love	Bee Gees	Todd & Belinda	10.21.19		I know your eyes in the morning sun. I feel you touch me in the pouring rain. And the moment that you wander far from me, I want to feel you in my arms again. And you come to me on a summer breeze, keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love? How deep is your love? How deep is your love? I really mean to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down when they all should let us be. We belong to you and me. I believe in you. You know the door to my very soul. You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour. You're my savior when I fall. And you may not think I care for you when you know down inside that I really do. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love? How deep is your love? How deep is your love? I really mean to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down when they all should let us be. We belong to you and me. And you come to me on a summer breeze, keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love? How deep is your love? How deep is your love?

I really mean to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down when they all should let us be. We belong to you and me. How deep is your love? How deep is your love? I really mean to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down when they all should let us be.	7

It's enough for me, baby, it's enough for me. Oh, heavenly day, heavenly day, heavenly day. Tomorrow may rain with sorrow, here's a little time we can borrow.

12011	The Impossible Dream	Robert Goulet	Bill & Cathy	01.25.69		To dream the impossible dream. To fight the unbeatable foe. To bear with unbearable sorrow. To run where the brave dare not go. To right the unrightable wrong. To love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary. To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to follow the star. No matter how hopeless, no matter how far, to fight for the right without question or pause. To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause.  And I know, if I'll only be true to this glorious quest, then my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest. And the world will be better for this, that one man scorned and covered with scars. Still strove with his last ounce of courage to reach the unreachable star. And I know, if I'll only be true to this glorious quest, then my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest. And the world will be better for this, that one man scorned and covered with scars. Still strove with his last ounce of courage to reach the unreachable star.	10

Because love is more precious than gold, it can't be bought, no never could be sold. I've got love enough to share, that makes me a millionaire.

12020	Push	Sara McLachlan	Matt & Teresa	09.30.06		Every time I look at you, the world just melts away. All my troubles, all my fears, dissolve in your affection. You've seen me at my weakest, but you take me as I am. And when I fall, you offer me a softer place to land. You stay the course, you hold the line, you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in. You're all the things that I desire, you save me. you complete me. You're the one true thing I know I can believe. I get mad so easy, but you give me room to breathe. No matter what I say or do 'cause you're too good to fight about it. Even when I have to push just to see how far you'll go. You won't stoop down to battle, but you never turn to go. You stay the course, you hold the line, you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in. You're all the things that I desire, you save me, you complete me. You're the one true thing I know I can believe. Your love is just the antidote when nothing else can cure me.

Sometimes that's just what we need to get us through the day. You stay the course, you hold the line, you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in. You're all the things that I desire, you save me, you complete me. You're the one true thing I know I can believe. You stay the course, you hold the line, you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in.	7.5
12028	Ode de Joy	Beethoven	Bob & Nikki	04.07.78		Joyful, joyful, we adore thee. God of glory, Lord of love, hearts unfold like flowers before thee. Opening to the sun above. Melt the clouds of sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt away. Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day! All thy works with joy surround thee, earth, and heaven reflect rays, stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise. Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea, chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in thee. Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blest, well-spring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest! Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are thine; teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine. Mortals, join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began; love divine is reigning o'er us, binding all within its span. Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife; joyful music leads us sunward, in the triumph song of life.	9
12035	Come What May	Moulin Rouge	Mark & Kristie	08.31.03		Never knew I could feel like this, like I've never seen the sky before. Want to vanish inside your kiss. Season may change, winter to spring, but I love you until the end of time. Come what may, come what may, I will love you until my dying day. Suddenly, the world seems such a perfect place. Suddenly, it moves with such a perfect grace. Suddenly, my life doesn't seem such a waste. All revolves around you, and there is no mountain too high, no river too wide. Sing out this song, and I'll be there by your side. Storm clouds may gather, and stars may collide. But I love you, I love you, until the end of time. Come what may, I will love you. Come what may, I will love you. Come what may, I will love you, until my dying day.	11

Someone was saying "I love you " to me. A one in a million, chance of a lifetime and life showed compassion and sent to me a stroke of love called you.

I thought that the world had lost its sway. (It's so hard sometimes) Then I fell in love with you (then came you) and you took that away. (It's not so difficult. The world is not so difficult) You take away the old, show me the new and I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you. So while I'm on this phone, a hundred miles from home I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you. I only want to see if you're okay when I'm not around.

12059	Aquaman	Walk The Moon	Keegan & Jarrod	04.30.16		The real life love is under the mirror of the surface so cut my cord I want to know how deep we can take it. See the thing you've been chasing, honey, you'll never find it wearin' a life vest. You gotta risk your neck, know in your heart it will be worth it. So here we go head first, no regrets and no rules. We can stay as long as we want, slow dancing in the darkness and all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on. It's been my fashion to keep my head dry and get my feet wet. Step by step I've been letting you lead me to the deep end. Well, I learned my lesson, honey , just when you think you're all adult swim is precisely when somebody shows you to the ocean. So here we go head first and no regrets and no rules. We can stay as long as we want, slow dancing in the darkness. And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on just keep holding on, holding on to me. Under, under the top of, the surface of the sea just keep holding on, holding on to me. Just keep holding on, holding on to me.

12065	Dancing in the Minefield	Andrew Peterson	Matt & Tisa	11.03.01		Well, I was nineteen, you were twenty-one the year we got engaged. And everyone said we were much too young but we did it anyway. We got the rings for forty each from a pawn shop down the road. We said our vows and took the leap now fifteen years ago. And we went dancing in the minefields, we went sailing in the storms. And it was harder than we dreamed but I believe that's what the promise is for. "I do" are the two most famous last words, the beginning of the end. But to lose your life for another, I've heard, is a good place to begin. 'Cause the only way to find your life is to lay your own life down. And I believe it's an easy price for the life that we have found. And we went dancing in the minefields, we went sailing in the storms. And it was harder than we dreamed but I believe that's what the promise is for, that's what the promise is for. So when I lose my way, find me. When I loose love’s chains, bind me. At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days, when I forget my name, remind me. 'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man so there's nothing left to fear. So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands till the shadows disappear. 'Cause He promised not to leave us and His promises are true. So in the face of all this chaos, baby, I can dance with you. So let's go dancing in the minefields, let's go sailing in the storms. Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields and kicking down the doors. Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields and sailing in the storms. Oh, this is harder than we dreamed but I believe that's what the promise is for, that's what the promise is for.	7

12082	Right here waiting	Richard Marx	Rod & Kathy	09.05.92		Oceans apart, day after day, and I slowly go insane. I hear your voice on the line but it doesn't stop the pain. If I see you next to never, how can we say forever? Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you.

12110	Go there with you	Stephen Curtis	Ronny & Heather	03.04.95		I know you've heard me say these words before, but every time I say I love you, the words mean something more. I spoke them as a promise right from the start. I said death would be the only thing that could tear us apart. And now that you are standing on the edge of the unknown. I love you means I'll be with you wherever you must go. I will take a heart whose nature is to beat for me alone and fill it up with you - make all your joy and pain my own. No matter how deep a valley you go through, I will go there with you. And I will give myself to love the way Love gave itself for me. And climb with you to mountaintops or swim a raging sea - to the place where one heart is made from two, I will go there with you. I see it in your tears - you wonder where you are. The wind is growing colder and the sky is growing dark. Though it's something neither of us understands, we can walk through this together if we hold each other's hand. I said for better or worse, I'd be with you. So no matter where you're going, I will go there, too. I will take a heart whose nature is to beat for me alone and fill it up with you - make all your joy and pain my own. No matter how deep a valley you go through, I will go there with you. I known sometimes I let you down, but I won't let you go - we'll always be together.	8

Put your toes down in the water and a smile across your face. And tell me that you love me, lovely Lady May. Now I ain't the sharpest chisel that your hands have ever held, but darling, I could love you well. Til' the roll is called on high. I've seen my share of trouble, and I've held my weight in shame. But I'm baptized in your name, lovely Lady May. Lord, the wind can leave you shiverin' as it waltzes o'er the leaves. It's been rushin' through my timber. Til' your love brought on the spring. Now the mountains all are blushin', and they don't know what to say. 'Cept a good long line of praises for, my lovely Lady May. Now I ain't the toughest hickory that your ax has ever felled, but I'm a hickory just as well. I'm a hickory all the same. I came crashin' through the forest as you cut my roots away. And I fell a good long ways for, my lovely Lady May.	9
12113	Se Me Sigue Olvidando	Marc Anthony				Amanece un día más que te llamo a pesar. Que tú no estás y es que todo alrededor. Me recuerda tanto a ti a tus cosas a ese amor. Que vive en mí que solo estoy no puedo más. Que alegría si quisieras regresar nuestra casa sigue igual. Todo espera tu llegar hay necesidad en mí. Por este amor ten compassion ya yo no puedo estar sin ti. Se me sigue olvidando que no estás y te busco a mi lado al despertar. Y me aferro a tu almohada sin querer que conserva el aroma de tu piel. Se me sigue olvidando que no estás que tu amor ya más nunca volverá. Más yo sigo soñando que vendrás pues no quiero aceptar la realidad. Que voy a hacer si estás en mí si te llamo cuando sé que te perdí. Y es que todo alrededor me recuerda tanto a ti. A tus cosas a ese amor que aún está vibrando en mí. Que no me deja ya vivir se me sigue. Olvidando que no estás y te busco a mi lado al despertar. Y me aferro a tu almohada sin querer que conserva el aroma de tu piel. Se me sigue olvidando que no estás que tu amor ya más nunca volverá. Más yo sigo soñando que vendrás pues no quiero aceptar la realidad. Se que te has marchado y te sigo esperando. Y es que se me sigue olvidando se me sigue olvidando que no estás. Converso en las noches con mi soledad. Se me sigue olvidando y me miro en el espejo. Y me pregunto a dónde estás se me sigue olvidando que no estás. No puedo aceptar que se me fue se me sigue olvidando. Y me hago daño cuanto te extraño. Y yo me engaño si pienso que te olvidé. Rubén! Levantalo, Sergio Jojoma! Se me sigue olvidando se me sigue, se me sigue. Se me sigue olvidando que te olvidé. Y yo conservo en mi mente que este amor está presente. Se me sigue olvidando yo no se ya que hacer, tu ves. Se me sigue olvidando. Se me sigue olvidando. Yo no se ya que voy hacer, tu ves. Ay yo no se yo no se yo no se. Ay yo no se yo no se yo no se. Se me sigue olvidando yo no se que voy hacer. Si no tengo tu querer. Se me sigue olvidando. Se me sigue olvidando. Se me sigue olvidando. Se me sigue olvidando.

12116	Heaven is a place on earth	Belinda Carlisle	Steven & Patricia	11.14.92		Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth? Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth. They say in heaven, love comes first. We'll make heaven a place on Earth, ooh, heaven is a place on Earth. When the night falls down, I wait for you and you come around and the world's alive with the sound of kids on the street outside. When you walk into the room, you pull me close and we start to move and we're spinning with the stars above and you lift me up in a wave of love. Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth? Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth. They say in heaven love comes first. We'll make heaven a place on Earth, ooh, heaven is a place on Earth. When I feel alone, I reach for you and you bring me home. When I'm lost at sea, I hear your voice and it carries me. In this world we're just beginning to understand the miracle of living. Baby I was afraid before but I'm not afraid anymore. Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth? Ooh heaven is a place on Earth. They say in heaven love comes first, we'll make heaven a place on earth. Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.

12122	If there hadn't been you	Billy Dean	Teri & George	02.05.94		A man filled with doubt down and out and so alone. A ship tossed and turned lost and yearning for a home. A survivor barely surviving not really sure of his next move. All of this, I would have been if there hadn't been you. If there hadn't been you where would I be if there hadn't been you here for me, I made it through times. I never would've made it through if there hadn't been you, a man filled with hope who finally knows where he belongs. A heart filled with love more than enough to keep it strong, a life that's alive again no longer afraid to face the truth. All of this, I would have missed if there hadn't been you. If there hadn't been you on my side, you in my life. All my dreams would still be dreams if there hadn't been you. All my dreams would still be dreams if there hadn't been you.	11
12124	Perfect	Sara Evans	Jason & Katie	10.17.08		If you don't take me to Paris on a lover's getaway, it's all right. It's all right. If I'd rather wear your T-shirt than a sexy negligee, it's all right. It's all right. Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit. It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be perfect. Baby, every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly. Love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams, but honey, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me. If your mother doesn't like the way I treat her baby boy, it's all right. It's all right. If in every wedding picture my daddy looks annoyed, it's all right. It's all right. Don't you know that fairy tales tell a lie? Real love and real-life doesn't have to be perfect. Baby, every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly. Love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams, but honey, if it's good enough for you. It's good enough for me. You don't mind if I show up late for everything and when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me. Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be perfect. Baby, every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly. Love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams, but honey, if it's good enough for you. It's good enough for me. It's good enough for me (perfect). Yeah, good enough for me (perfect). Good enough for me (perfect).	8
12126	Ever the same	Rob Thomas	Jeremy & Stefanie	05.20.06		We were drawn from the weeds. We were brave like soldiers, falling down under the pale moonlight. You were holding to me like a someone broken and I couldn't tell you, but I'm telling you now, just let me hold you while you're falling apart, just let me hold you so we both fall down. Fall on me, tell me everything you want me to be, forever with you forever in me, ever the same. We would stand in the wind, we were free like water flowing down under the warmth of the sun. Now it's cold, and we're scared and we've both been shaken. Look at us, man, this doesn't need to be the end. Just let me hold you while you're falling apart, just let me hold you so we both fall down. Fall on me, tell me everything you want me to be, forever with you, forever in me, ever the same. Call on me, I'll be there for you, and you'll be there for me. Forever it's you, forever in me, ever the same. You may need me there to carry all your weight but you're no burden I assure. You tide me over with a warmth I'll not forget but I can only give you love.	9

12205	Breathe	Faith Hill	Joshua & Angel	02.14.03		I can feel the magic floating in the air. Being with you gets me that way. I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've never been this swept away. All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze. When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms, the whole world just fades away. The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart. 'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me. Suddenly I'm melting into you. There's nothing left to prove, baby, all we need is just to be caught up in the touch. The slow and steady rush, baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be. I can feel you breathe, just breathe. In a way I know my heart is waking up as all the walls come tumbling down. I'm closer than I've ever felt before and I know, and you know, there's no need for words right now. 'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me. Suddenly I'm melting into you.

12208	When she dance	David Foster	Betsy & Chris	07.30.16		Can you go back in time? To a place in your mind, to the one who knew a part of you that you just couldn't find. If you ask me to choose between a memory or two. When it's said, and done, I'll take the one who's love I had to lose. Cause when she danced, I lost my inner sense, I loved her then and always will. She left with me a burnin' memory. She took with her a part of me. If I could get back where I've been, feel the passion I felt then, I'd be there right now and yet somehow. It never comes again. She had nothin' to gain (nowhere to go), to the way out of pain (the time with). With a song and dance, she lost romance. The world had gone insane. Cause when she danced, I lost my inner sense, I loved her then and always will.	11
12212	Fly Love	Jamie Foxx	Eric & Shannon	12.18.05		Wasn't really thinkin', wasn't lookin' , wasn't searching for an answer in the moonlight when I saw your face. Saw you lookin' at me, saw you peeking out from under moon beams through the palm trees, swayin' in the breeze. I know I'm feelin' so much more than ever before and so I'm giving more to you than I thought I could do. Don't know how it happened, don't know why but you don't really need a reason. When the stars shine just to fall in love, made to love each other made to be together for a life time in the sunshine flying in the sky. I know I'm feelin' so much more than ever before and so I'm giving more to you than I thought I could do. Ooh. Now I know love is real so when the sky high as the angels try. Letting you and I fly love.	11

12214	Let Me Down Easy	Billy Currington	Greg & Riley	02.14.15		There's a little moonlight dancing on the sand. There's a warm breeze blowing by the ocean as you're taking my hand. You need to know where I'm standing now, that I'm right on the edge of giving into ya. Baby, it's a long way down. If I fall, can you let me down easy? If I leave my heart with you tonight, will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right? I'm barely hangin' on. If I fall, can you let me down easy? The scent of your perfume floatin' in the air. You're looking like an angel lying on a blanket with a halo of hair. And those lips look too good to be true. Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen. I'll be at the mercy of you. If I fall, can you let me down easy? If I leave my heart with you tonight, will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right? I'm barely hangin' on. If I fall, can you let me down easy?

When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine, that's amore. Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling. And you'll sing, "Vita Bella."

12221	Young at Heart	Frank Sinatra			I do not want names or date, just the song.	Fairy tales can come true it can happen to you, if you're young at heart. For it's hard, you will find to be narrow of mind if you're young at heart. You can go to extremes with impossible schemes. You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams. And life gets more exciting with each passing day. And love is either in your heart or on its way. Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth to be young at heart? For as rich as you are It's much better by far to be young at heart. And if you should survive to a hundred and five, look at all you'll derive out of being alive. And here is the best part, you have a head start if you are among the very young at heart. And if you should survive to a hundred and five, look at all you'll derive out of being alive. And here is the best part, you have a head start if you are among the very young at heart.	10
12223	Love Can't Stand Alone	Bears Den	Blake & Krista	12.16.17		I remember the night you lost to me. All of the fires still burn within you started choking down vitamins if I mentioned his name. I was sent to bed, you check if I'd gone to sleep, and I closed my eyes and heard you leave. I pray for the day my prayers will mend, but nothing ever came that was heaven-sent. Driving in your car you said, you had the thought gonna call it all and write it off. You sat there and cried 'til the morning come, and what you said don't you ever think I forgot. I'll never leave you out in the cold. I'll never leave you out in the cold. I'll never leave you out in the cold. Love can't stand alone. Love can't stand. I think of him from time to time just what it is he left behind. His life alone, I'll always remind we've all the things we have to look to find. Of the strength, we both had to find.

12224	Lovefool	The Cardigans	Rob & Von	01.03.03		Dear, I fear we're facing a problem you love me no longer, I know. And maybe there is nothing that I can do to make you do. Mama tells me I shouldn't bother that I ought to stick to another man. A man that surely deserves me, but I think you do. So I cry, I pray, and I beg. Love me, love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on, and fool me. Love me, love me, pretend that you love me. Leave me, leave me, just say that you need me. So I cy, and I beg for you to love me, love me, say that you love me. Leave me, leave me, just say that you need me. I can't care about anything but you. Lately, I have desperately pondered spent my nights awake, and I wonder what I could have done in another way to make you stay. Reason will not lead to solution, I will end up lost in confusion. I don't care if you really care, as long as you don't go. So I cry, I pray, and I beg. Love me, love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on, and fool me. Love me, love me, pretend that you love me. Leave me, leave me, just say that you need me. So I cry, and I beg for you to love me, love me, say that you love me.

12226	You	Rascal Flatts	Chad & Amy	09.21.13		Every road that I've been down. The only truth that I have found there's only one thing I can't live without, you. I was searching for something I thought I would never find. Losing my mind, in and out of bad love, I thought I was born to lose, then came you. I thought I knew what the real thing was, but nothing shakes me like your love does. I've been hypnotized. Now, I realize every road that I've been down. The only truth that I have found there's only one thing I can't live without, you. Every time I get lost in a temperamental mood, you still stay cool. Just when I think that this life's about to drive me insane, you take the reins. Every time I feel I'm drifting off course, you're my compass. You're my one true north in a mixed-up world. (Mixed-up world) You make sense to me, girl. Every road that I've been down. The only truth that I have found there's only one thing I can't live without, you. Yeah, every road, girl, leads me to you. And baby, that's all I need to know. Every road that I've been down. The only truth that I have found there's only one thing I can't live without, you. Every road that I've been down. The only truth that I have found there's only one thing I can't live without, you. Every road that I've been down in my life. Every time I feel I'm taking off. Every road that I've been down in my life. Every road, girl, leads me to you. Yes, it did. Yes, it did. Every road, girl, every road leads me to you.	7.5
12229	This I Promise You	Ronan Keating	Lorence & Barbara	06.17.18		My love, here I stand before you. I am yours now from this moment on. Take my hand. Only you can stop me shaking. We'll share forever. This I promise you. And when I look in your eyes, all of my life is before me. And I'm not running anymore 'cause I already know I'm home. With every beat of my heart, I'll give you my love completely. My darling, this I promise you. My love, I can feel your heartbeat as we dance now closer than before. Don't let go.

12231	That’s All	Alan Brandt & Bob Haynes	John & Mary	09.13.03		I can only give you love that lasts forever and a promise to be near each time you call. And the only heart I own, for you and you alone. That's all, that's all. I can only give you country walks in springtime. And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall, and a love whose burning light will warm the winter night. That's all, that's all. There are those, I am sure, who have told you. They would give you the world for a toy. All I have are these arms to enfold you, and a love time can never destroy. If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear. You'll be glad to know that my demands are small. Say it's me that you'll adore for now and evermore. That's all, that's all.	10
12233	Something That We Do	Clint Black	David & Amie	08.08.98		I remember well the day we wed; I can see that picture in my head. I still believe the words we said, "Forever will ring true." Love is certain, love is kind. Love is yours and love is mine. But it isn't somethin' that we find - it's somethin' that we do. It's holding tight, It's lettin' go. It's flyin' high and layin' low. It lets your strongest feelin's show and your weakness too. It's a little and a lot to ask, an endless and a welcome task. Love isn't somethin' that we have - it's somethin' that we do. We help to make each other all that we can be. Though we can find our strength and inspiration, independently. The way we work together is what sets our love apart so closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start. It gives me heart remembering how we started with a simple vow. There's so much to look back on now, still it feels brand new. We're on a road that has no end. And each day we begin again. Love's not just somethin' that we're in - it's somethin' that we do. We help to make each other all that we can be. We can find our strength and inspiration, independently. The way we work together is what sets our love apart so closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start. Love is wide, love is long. Love is deep, and love is strong. Love is why I love this song. And I hope you love it too. I remember well the day we wed; I can see that picture in my head. Love isn't just those words we said - it's somethin' that we do. There's no request, too big or small. We give ourselves, we give our all. Love isn't some place that we fall - it's somethin' that we do.	7
12235	Can You Feel The Love Tonight	Elton John	Phil & Kayla	05.24.20		There's a calm surrender to the rush of day when the heat of a rolling wave can be turned away. An enchanted moment, and it sees me through, it's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you. And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are. It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we've got this far. And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight) How it's laid to rest? It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best. There's a time for everyone if they only learn that the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn. There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors when the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours. And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight) It is where we are. It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we've got this far. And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight) How it's laid to rest? It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best. It's enough to make kings and vagabonds. Believe the very best.	9
12239	Lucky Man	The Verve	Zac & Jen	08.01.11		Happiness, more or less, it's just a change in me, something in my liberty. Oh, my, my, happiness. Coming and going, I watch you look at me, watch my fever growing. I know just where I am. But how many corners do I have to turn? How many times do I have to learn? All the love I have is in my mind?

Yeah, it feels like springtime in winter, it feels like Christmas in June. It feels like heaven has opened up its gates for me and you.

Yeah, and you've got me too, and every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause I don't believe it's true, yeah. That someone like you loves me too, yeah.

12242	Stolen	Dashboard Confessional	Christopher & Sarah	06.05.10		We watched the season pull up its own stage. And catch the last weekend of the last week. Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced, another sun-soaked season fades away. You have stolen my heart. You have stolen my heart. Invitation only grant farewells, crash the best one of the best ones. Clear liquor and cloudy eyed, too early to say goodnight. You have stolen my heart. You have stolen my heart. And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration. One good stretch before our hibernation. Our dreams assured and we all, we'll sleep well. Sleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep well. You have stolen. (my) You have stolen. (my) You have stolen my heart. I watch you spin around in your highest heels. You are the best one of the best ones. We all look like we feel.

12245	Always In My Heart	Bob Seger	Randy & Darlena	03.14.92		I think of you and I together. I picture you and I as one when we sit there in the firelight baby. When we wake to the morning sun, and though you may leave me, we're never apart. You're Always In My Heart. When you're standing at the window, with the moonlight in your hair, and you turn and smile, my favorite smile. I just have to stop and stare and babe, when you hold me, I go off the chart. You're Always In My Heart. Stay with me stay. Stay with me, babe, forever be by my side. Let's spend our lives together. I picture you and I together.

12248	You Are My Sunshine	Morgan Stapleton	Sean & Steph	10.20.18		You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away. The other night dear, while I lay sleeping.

12249	First Time Ever I Saw Your Face	Johnny Cash	Sean & Stephanie	07.27.13		The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes. And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave, to the dark and the endless sky, my love.

There's a blaze of light in every word it doesn't matter which you heard. The holy or the broken. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

12313	 Love Will Be Our Home	Sandi Patty	 Ray & Kathy Daniels	03.21.92		If home is really where the heart is, then home must be a place that we all share.

Wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there. Love will be our home. Where there are children singing, where a tender heart is beating, we can live together there. Love will be our home. With love, our hearts can be a family, and hope can bring this family face to face. And though we may be far apart, our hearts can be as one when love brings us together in one place.

12491	Origin of Love	Hedwig & The Angry Inch	 Jeff & Katie	7.30.11        When the earth was still flat and the clouds made of fire. And the mountains stretched up to the sky sometimes higher. Folks roamed the earth like big rolling kegs. They had two sets of arms. They had two sets of legs. They had two faces peering out of one giant head.So they could watch all around them as they talked while they read. And they never knew nothing of love it was before the origin of love, origin of love. The origin of love, origin of love. Well, there were three sexes then one that looked like two men glued on back to back, they were the children of the sun. And similar in shape girth were the children of the earth, they looked like two girls rolled up in one. And the children of the moon was like a fork shoved on a spoon. They were part sun part earth, part daughter, part son. Oh, the origin of love. Well, the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance. And Thor said, "I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer like I killed the giants." But Zeus said, "No, you'd better let me use my lightning-like scissors. Like I cut the legs off the whales, dinosaurs into lizards." Then he grabbed up some bolts, he let out a laugh, said, "I'll split them right down the middle, gonna cut them right up in half." And then storm clouds gathered above into great balls of fire. And then fire shot down from the sky in bolts, like shining blades of a knife. And it ripped, right through the flesh of the children of the sun and the moon and the earth. And some Indian god sewed the wound up to a hole turned it 'round to our bellies to remind us the price we paid. And Osiris and the gods of the Nile gathered up a big storm to blow a hurricane to scatter us away. A flood of wind and rain, a sea of tidal waves to wash us all away. And if we don't behave, they'll cut us down again. And we'll be hopping 'round on one foot looking through one eye. The last time I saw you, we had just split in two. He was looking at me. I was looking at you. You had a way so familiar I could not recognize 'cause you had blood on your face. And I had blood in my eyes. But I swear by your expression, that the pain down in your soul, was the same, as the one down in mine. That's the pain that cuts a straight line down through the heart. We call it love. We wrapped our arms around each other. Tried to shove ourselves back together. We were making love, making love. It was a cold dark evening, such a long time ago. When by the mighty hand of Jove, it was a sad story how we became, lonely two-legged creatures. The story, the origin of love. That's the origin of love. Oh yeah, the origin of love. The origin of love, the origin of love.

When someone dries your tears, when someone wins your heart and says you’re beautiful. When you don't know you are and all you've longed to see is written on his face. When love has come and finally set you free, on that wedding day, on that wedding day. She has danced in golden castles, and she has crawled through beggar's dust, but today, she stands before him, and she wears his righteousness, and she will be who he adores, and this is what he made her for. When someone dries your tears, when someone wins your heart and says you’re beautiful. When you don't know you are and all you've longed to see is written on his face. When love has come and finally set you free, on that wedding day, on that wedding day. When the hand that bears the only scars and heaven touch her face, and the last tears she'll ever cry are finally wiped away. And the clouds roll back as he takes her hand and walks her through the gates. Forever we will reign. When someone dries your tears, when someone wins your heart and says you’re beautiful. When you don't know you are and all you've longed to see is written on his face. When love has come and finally set you free, on that wedding day, on that wedding day.	7
12515	I Like Where This Is Going	Cale Dodds	Kyle & Lindsey	05.29.20		Down a two-lane with no name, I'm halfway to your place. Watching wheat fields bend while the slow dance wind is blowing. When I pull up, I see you in a sundress with your sun-kissed shoulder showing. Yeah, I like where this is going. The stars ain't started to glow, but we both know that they're all coming. The cork still stuck in the bottle, but that bottle's in your hand. The needle ain't on the vinyl yet, but I'm dropping it 'cause you're already starting to dance. It kinda feels like this whole night is in slow motion. I like where this is going. If I had to guess what would happen next, it'd be your head on my chest. While the clock on the wall will stand still like it's broken. Maybe one kiss turns into two, turns into me waking up with you in the morning. Yeah, I like where this is going. The stars ain't started to glow, but we both know that they're all coming. The cork's still stuck in the bottle, but that bottle's in your hand. The needle ain't on the vinyl yet, but I'm dropping it 'cause you're already starting to dance. It kinda feels like this whole night is in slow motion. I like where this is going. The stars ain't started to glow, but we both know that they're all coming. The cork's still stuck in the bottle, but that bottle's in your hand.

12534	I'm Stoned In Love With You	The Stylistics	Julian & Sarah	14.02.12		If I could, I'd like to be a great big movie star, overnight sensation, drive a big expensive car. I would buy you everything your little heart desires. These things I do, 'cause I'm stone in love with you. If I were a businessman, I'd sit behind a desk, I'd be so successful, I would scare wall street to death, I would hold a meeting for the press, to let them know I did it all, 'cause I'm stone in love with you. I'm just a man, an average man doing everything the best I can. But if I could, I'd give the world to you. I'd like to someday be the owner of the first house on the moon. There would be no neighbors and no population boom. You might say that all I do is dream my life away. I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love for you. I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love with you. I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love for you.	10
12536	Only God Could Love You More	Kelly Thompson	Ricky & Shasta	09.21.02		I asked the Lord for someone, and I always knew that in God's time and in God's way, it would be someone like you. All my hopes and all my dreams were suddenly fulfilled. It's almost unbelievable our love was in His will. Only God could love you more, for He gave me this love I have for you. What a blessing to know He's your Lord, only God could love you more than I do. I'm tempted to be saying that we met by chance, but God was there at every turn in every circumstance. To share this life God gave me seems such a fearful task, but every moment we have shared is more than I could ask. Only God could love you more, for He gave me this love I have for you.

12538	This Must Be The Place	Talking Heads	Colin & Keri	05.14.16		Home is where I want to be. Pick me up and turn me around, I feel numb, born with a weak heart. I guess I must be having fun. The less we say about it, the better. Make it up as we go along, feet on the ground, head in the sky. It's okay, I know, nothing's wrong, nothing. Oh, I got plenty of time. Oh, you got light in your eyes, and you're standing here beside me. I love the passing of time. Never for money, always for love. Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight. Home is where I want to be. But I guess I'm already there. I come home, she lifted up her wings. I guess that this must be the place. I can't tell one from the other. I find you, or you find me. There was a time before we were born. If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be, oh. We drift in and out. Oh, sing into my mouth out of all those kinds of people. You got a face with a view. I'm just an animal looking for a home and share the same space for a minute or two. And you love me till my heart stops, love me till I'm dead. Eyes that light up, eyes look through you. Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head I got, ooh.	9
12539	Lovin' You	Minnie Riperton	Ricardo & Silvia	07.22.15		Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful. Makin' love with you is all I wanna do.

12544	You Are My Sunshine	The Hound & Fox	Emmett & Andy			You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away. The other night dear, as I lay sleeping. I dreamt I held you in my arms and now that you're here.

You'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away. I'll always love you and make you happy.

12547	When You Say Nothing At All	Keith Whitley	Jason & Shanna	10.22.16		It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart. Without saying a word, you can light up the dark. Try as I may, I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall. Now you say it best when you say nothing at all. All-day long, I can hear people talking out loud. But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd. Old Mister Webster can never define what's being said between your heart and mine. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall. Now you say it best when you say nothing at all. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall. Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.	9
12548	What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life	Michel Legrand	Steve & Janice	10.13.73		I want to see your face in every kind of light, in fields of dawn and forests of the night. And when you stand before the candles on a cake, oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make. What are you doing the rest of your life? North and South, and East and West of your life. I have only one request of your life that you spend it all with me. All the seasons and the times of your days, all the nickels and the dimes of your days. Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days all begin and end with me. I want to see your face in every kind of light, in the fields of dawn and the forests of the night. And when you stand before the candles on a cake, oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make. Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes, in the world of love that you keep in your eyes. I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes. It may take a kiss or two. Through all of my life, summer, winter, spring, and fall of my life. All I ever will recall of my life is all of my life with you.	9
12549	Crazy For You	Madonna	BJ & Kelly	01.01.19		Swaying room as the music starts. Strangers making the most of the dark, two by two their bodies become one. I see you through the smokey air, can't you feel the weight of my stare. You're so close but still a world away. What I'm dying to say is that I'm crazy for you. Touch me once, and you'll know it's true, I never wanted anyone like this, it's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss. I'm crazy for you, crazy for you. Trying hard to control my heart, I walk over to where you are, eye to eye we need no words at all. Slowly now, we begin to move. Every breath I'm deeper into you, soon we two are standing still in time. If you read my mind, you'll see I'm crazy for you. Touch me once, and you'll know it's true, I never wanted anyone like this, it's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss, you'll feel it in my kiss because I'm crazy for you. Touch me once, and you'll know it's true, I never wanted anyone like this, it's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss. I'm crazy for you, crazy for you, crazy for you, crazy for you. It's all brand new. I'm crazy for you and you know it's true. I'm crazy, crazy for you. It's all brand new. I'm crazy for you and you know it's true. Yeah, I'm crazy for you, crazy for you, baby.	8
12550	Give In To Me	Garrett Hedlund & Leighton Meester	Bobby & Reggie	06.29.12		I'm gonna wear you down. I'm gonna make you see. I'm gonna get to you. You're gonna give into me. I'm gonna start a fire. You're gonna feel the heat. I'm gonna burn for you. You're gonna melt for me. Come on, come on into my arms. Come on, come on give into me. You're gonna take my hand whisper the sweetest words and if you're ever sad, I'll make you laugh, I'll chase the hurt. My heart is set on you, I don't want no one else. And if you don't want me, I guess I'll be all by myself. Come on, come on into my arms. Come on, come on, give into me. I'll use my eyes to draw you in until I'm under your skin. I'll use my lips, I'll use my arms, come on, come on, come on give into me. Give into me, give into me.	11
12551	Summerwind	Frank Sinatra	Jon & Jennifer	04.27.96		The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea. It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me. All summer long we sang a song. And then we strolled that golden sand, two sweethearts and the summer wind. Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by. The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky. Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you. I lost you, I lost you, to the summer wind. The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone and still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on. And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end. My fickle friend, the summer wind. The summer wind, warm summer wind. The summer wind.	11
12552	The Rose	Bette Midler	Scott & Maureen	08.03.85		Some say, love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed. Some say, love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed. Some say, love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need. I say, love, it is a flower and you, its only seed. It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance. It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance. It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give. And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live. When the night has been too lonely, and the road has been too long, and you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong. Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snows lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose.	11
12554	Evergreen	Barbra Streisand	Charles & Kim	04.15.77		Love, soft as an easy chair. Love, fresh as the morning air. One love that is shared by two, I have found with you. Like a rose under the April snow, I was always certain love would grow. Love ageless and evergreen seldom seen by two. You and I will make each night a first every day a beginning. Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed. They warm and excite us 'cause we have the brightest love. Two lights that shine as one, morning glory and midnight sun. Time we've learned to sail above, time won't change the meaning of one love, ageless and ever evergreen.	13
12562	Lady	Lionel Richie	Mohamed & Hanan	10.10.88		Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor, and I love you. You have made me what I am, and I'm yours. My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you. Let me hold you in my arms, forevermore. You have gone and made me such a fool. I'm so lost in your love. And oh, girl, we belong together, won't you believe in my song? Lady, for so many years, I thought I'd never find you. You have come into my life and made me whole. Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning, let me hear you whisper softly in my ear. In my eyes, I see no one else but you. There's no other love like our love. Oh yes, girl, I'll always want you near me. I've waited for you for so long. Oh, lady, your love's the only love I need, and beside me is where I want you to be. 'Cause, my love, my love, there's somethin' I want you to know. You're the love of my life, of my life, you're my lady. You're my lady.	10
12564	Angel	Casting Crowns	Mark & Fay	10.19.19		It was a day, just like any other day. I was a boy, just like every other boy. But when the girl, unlike any I had seen. It's like she stepped out of a dream and into my world. Could have been the summer wind playing with her hair. As the sun danced in her eyes, we were standing there, she smiled. I forgot my name 'cause all I was thinking. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm praying that an angel will love me, an angel will love me. Maybe I'm a fool, but I'm still falling. Asking heaven above me for an angel to love me the rest of my life. You're the proof that the Father answers prayers 'cause somehow, someway, you and I are standing here with the sacred promise and a ring that says it all. I've just begun to fall from the deepest part of me I say I do. Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying, that an angel will love me, an angel will love me. Maybe I'm a fool, but I'm still falling. Asking heaven above me for an angel to love me the rest of my life. After all the changing seasons have turned to years, the crowns are gone, and the suns have faded. I'd still be here holding you when thanking heaven for my angel. Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying, that an angel will love me, an angel will love me. Maybe I'm a fool, but I'm still falling. Asking heaven above me for an angel to love me the rest of my life.	8
12565			Andrew & Barbara	04.27.13	The above is the song my husband wrote for me.	When I find her, you will know it, and so will I when I find her. The sky might fall, and I won't care why the silent soul inside of me can't survive alone. One more day is all I need to find the one I'll call my own 'cause I've been waiting for this moment, I think, for all my life but when I wake up at night, the dream disappears into the light. When I find her, I know the lock will be secure. When I find her days may pass and I'll be sure that the moment I've been waiting for was well worth the wait. And suddenly, my heart will sing now that I've found her. Love every moment of life, embrace everyone who does too. Love every moment we share. Embrace me, to know how I care. What more can I say? Except that, I want you to stay for a while with me, can't you see, this is where you belong. You are the love of my life, let's grow old together, side by side and now, it's come, the time when I want you to say, tonight, you'll be my wife for all time, and wherever you go, the whole world will know that you're my wife, my love.  Just tell me you'll be forever with me.	#N/A
12566	Crazy	Patsy Cline	Sean & Nicholle	05.16.98		Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely. I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue. I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted, and then someday you'd leave me for somebody new. Worry, why do I let myself worry? Wondering what in the world did I do? Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you. I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying, and I'm crazy for loving you. Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you. I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying, and I'm crazy for loving you.	14
12571	Love Song	The Cure	Kevin & Kari	09.11.90		Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am home again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am whole again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am young again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am fun again. However, far away, I will always love you. However, long I stay, I will always love you. Whatever words I say, I will always love you. I will always love you. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am free again. Whenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am clean again. However, far away, I will always love you. However, long I stay, I will always love you. Whatever words I say I will always love you, I will always love you. However, far away, I will always love you. However, long I stay, I will always love you. Whatever words I say I will always love you, I will always love you. I will always love you 'cause I love you.	10

12577	After All These Years	Journey	Scott & Gale	09.10.88		A faded wedding photograph. You and me in our first dance, our eyes are closed, we're lost in one sweet embrace. Since those days, the world has changed but our love remains the same. God knows we've had our share of saving grace and I'm proud of all the blessings you have given me. The mountains we have climbed to get this far, we've learned to take the laughter with the tears. After all these years, you make it feel brand new. After the fires that we walked through, against the odds we never lost our faith. In a house we've made our own, where our children all have grown, precious moments time cannot erase. Make a living up and down the gypsy highways, seasons that we've had to share apart. Somehow in my heart I always keep you near, after all these years. After all these years, you stood by me the days and nights that I was gone. After all these years, you sacrificed, believed in me and you stood strong 'cause with our love there's nothing left to fear, after all these years. After all these years, you stood by me the days and nights that I was gone. After all these years, you sacrificed, believed in me and you stood strong 'cause with our love there's nothing left to fear, after all these years.	8
12587	When A Man Loves A Woman	Percy Sledge	Lonny & Jennifer	01.27.90		When a man loves a woman, can't keep his mind on nothin' else. He'd trade the world for a good thing he's found. If she is bad, he can't see it. She can do no wrong, turn his back on his best friend if he puts her down. When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime trying to hold on to what he needs. He'd give up all his comforts and sleep out in the rain if she said that's the way it ought to be. When a man loves a woman, I give you everything I got. Trying to hold on to your precious love, baby, please don't treat me bad. When a man loves a woman deep down in his soul. She can bring him such misery if she is playing him for a fool, he's the last one to know. Loving eyes can never see. Yes when a man loves a woman I know exactly how he feels. 'Cause baby, baby, baby I am a man, when a man loves a woman.	11
12588	Photograph	Ed Sheeran	Ron & Laura			Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes. But it's the only thing that I know when it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes. It is the only thing that makes us feel alive. We keep this love in a photograph. We made these memories for ourselves. Where our eyes are never closing, hearts are never broken, and time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans. Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet. You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home. And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby. Only words bleed, inside these pages you just hold me and I won't ever let you go. Wait for me to come home. Love can heal. Loving can mend your soul. And it's the only thing that I know, know. I swear it will get easier remember that with every piece of you. Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die. You can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen next to your heartbeat where I should be. Keep it deep within your soul, when I'm away I will remember how you kissed me, under the lamppost back on Sixth Street. Hearing you whisper through the phone, "Wait for me to come home."	8
12589	Everything	Lifehouse	Craig & Karen	09.10.11		Find me here, and speak to me. I want to feel you, I need to hear you. You are the light that's leading me to the place where I find peace again. You are the strength that keeps me walking, you are the hope that keeps me trusting. You are the life to my soul, you are my purpose, you're everything and how can I stand here with you, and not be moved by you. Would you tell me how could it be any better than this? You calm the storms and you give me rest. You hold me in your hands, you won't let me fall. You steal my heart and you take my breath away. Would you take me in, take me deeper now and how can I stand here with you, and not be moved by you. Would you tell me how could it be any better than this? And how can I stand here with you, and not be moved by you. Would you tell me how could it be any better than this? Cause you're all I want, you're all I need, you're everything, everything.

If I could be the voice on your radio, then I could be your long ride home. If mine could be the name that changes yours, the wine in your glass, the swing on your porch, the dollar in your pocket, and the peaceful in your sleep, then I'd be what you mean to me. Standing here watching you, turning every head in this crowded room. The lights down low, dancin slow. Oh, if falling's how you feel and perfect is what you see, then I'd be what you mean to me. Oh yeah, if I could be the fire in your firefly. The cool in the rain, the spark in your eye, the answer to your prayer, and the faith that sets you free. Then I'd be what you mean to me.

12606	Better Place	Rachel Platten	Mark & Crystal	08.12.16		I'll tell the world, I'll sing a song. It's a better place since you came along, since you came along. Your touch is sunlight through the trees. Your kisses are the ocean breeze. Everything's alright when you're with me. And I hold my favorite thing, I hold the love that you bring. But it feels like I've opened my eyes again and the colors are golden and bright again. There's a song in my heart, I feel like I belong. It's a better place since you came along.

12607	You For Me	Johnny Gill	Jace & Kelly	10.24.20		It seems like forever that I have waited for you. In a world of disappointment, one thing is true. God has blessed me, and He's blessed you too. In a world of lonely people, I've found you. Take my hand and hold me close and don't let me go. You for me, and me for you, together we'll make one. We were once strangers all by ourselves. Living, living alone with no one else. But here we are and it's so, so sweet. God must have done this, made you for me, and oh. Take my hand hold me close, don't let me go. You for me, me for you, together we'll make one. We were always sleeping on the first thing we've start. Dreaming, dreaming some love, wondering where you are. How blessed I am that I've found you. Now that you're here, I pray to say, "I do." Oh, take my hand and hold me close and don't let me go. You for me, and me for you, together we'll make one.

12608	Iris	Goo Goo Dolls	Travis & Dana	10.14.17		And I'd give up forever to touch you 'cause I know that you feel me somehow. You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't wanna go home right now. And all I can taste is this moment, and all I can breathe is your life. When sooner or later it's over, I just don't wanna miss you tonight. And I don't want the world to see me 'cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am. And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming or the moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies, yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive. And I don't want the world to see me 'cause I don't think that they'd understand.

12610	Storms Never Last	Jessi Colter & Waylon Jennings	Ted & Tiffaney			Storms never last, do they, baby. Bad times all pass with the winds. Your hand in mine stills the thunder. You make the sun want to shine. Oh, I have followed you down so many roads, baby. I picked wildflowers and sung you soft sad songs, and every road we took God knows our search was for the truth, and the storm brewing now won't be the last. Storms never last, do they, baby. Bad times all pass with the winds. Your hand in mine stills the thunder. You make the sun want to shine. Storms never last, do they, baby. Bad times all pass with the winds.

12613	Joyful Girl	Dave Matthews & Soulive	Robyn & Erin	01.21.19		You do it for the joy it brings because you're a joyful girl. Because the world owes me nothing, and we owe each other the world. I do it 'cause it's the least I can do. I do it 'cause I learned it from you. I do it just because I want to, just because I want to. Everything I do is judged and they mostly get it wrong, but, oh well. The bathroom mirror has not budged. The woman who lives there can tell. The truth from the stuff that they say. She looks me in the eye and says, "Would you prefer the easy way? No, well, okay, then don't cry." I wonder if everything I do, I do instead of something I want to do more. Question fills my head. I know there's no grand plan here, this is just the way it goes. When everything else seems unclear, I guess at least I know. You do it for the joy it brings because you're a joyful girl. Because the world owes me nothing, and we owe each other the world. I do it it's the least I can do, I do it, I learned it from you. I do it just because I want to, just because I want to.	9

She's got eyes that cut you like a knife and lips that taste like sweet red wine and pretty legs go to heaven every time. She got a gentle way that puts me at ease. When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe. Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees. She's got whatever it is. It blows me away. She's everything I wanted to say to a woman but couldn't find the words to say. She's got whatever it is. I don't know what to do because every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you". You got whatever it is. You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay. Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day, but that all changed when she walked into my life. People ask me what it is, I tell them I don't know. Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire. She's gonna be my wife. She's got whatever it is, it blows me away. She's everything I wanted to say to a woman but couldn't find the words to say. She's got whatever it is. I don't know what to do because every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you". You got whatever it is 'cause when she loves me, girl that's how I feel. 'Cause when she loves me, I'm on top of the world because when she loves me I can live forever. When she loves me, I am untouchable. She's got whatever it is, it blows me away. She's everything I wanted to say to a woman but couldn't find the words to say. She's got whatever it is. I don't know what to do because every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you" (I do). You got whatever it is.	7
12617	The Way	Bruce Springsteen	Steve & Wendy	02.15.20		The way your heart beats when I hold you tight. The way you sigh when we kiss goodnight. The way the wind blows through the trees. Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. The way you warm me, baby, when I'm cold. The way you make me want your body and soul. The way the rivers run to the sea. Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. The way you soothe me when I'm in pain. The way you make the blood rush in my veins. The way the winds rush through the trees. Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. When I lose faith, you take my hand the way you make me feel like I'm a man. The way the sun belongs to the sea. Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. The way you make me feel like I belong. And if I could, girl though I know it'd be wrong, I'd lock you deep inside 'till the last rains fall. And hide you from the emptiness of it all. Sometimes, at night I lie awake, I pull you close and feel each breath you take. The way the rivers belong to the seas. Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. Hmmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmmm.	8

If you want me to, I will. For if I ever saw you, I didn't catch your name, but it never really mattered. I will always feel the same. Love you forever and forever. Love you with all my heart.

12623			Bill & Sharon	04.25.15	I will send original lyrics via email.	There was a girl, so the story goes, who saw herself as a faded rose. A beauty that was hidden 'til she knew you. You kissed her lips, and you touched her soul. You stirred her heart, and you made her whole. And with humble joy, she cries out, hallelujah, hallelujah. There was a man who lived alone, whose heart could never find a home. And day would follow day until he knew you. With your eyes, you touched his soul. And with your love, you made him whole. And with humble joy, he cries out, hallelujah, hallelujah. They stand before God above, they pledge their hearts, and they pledge their love. And as one, they will begin life anew. Today, the Lord will weave their souls, will bind their hearts, and will make them whole. And in joyous strain, they cry out, hallelujah.	#N/A

And now, that I'm strong, I have figured out how this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul. And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one. I will never let you fall. (let you fall) I'll stand up with you forever. I'll be there for you through it all. (through it all) Even if saving you sends me to heaven. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

12678	 Close Your Eyes	Michael Buble	 Deuayne & Leesa 	 19.01.19		Close your eyes, let me tell you the reasons why, think you're one of a kind. Here's to you, the one that I suppose is true. Do what you got to do, you're one of a kind. Thank god your mine. You're an angel dressed in armor. You're the fair in every fight. You're my life and my safe harbor where the sun sets every night. And if my love is blind, I don't want to see the light. It's your beauty that betrays you. Your smile gives you away 'cause you're made of strength and mercy. And my soul is yours to save and when this much is true, when my world was dark and blue, I know the only one who rescued me was you. Close your eyes, let me tell you all the reasons why.

12796	Beautiful Day	U2	Steve & Shelly	12.28.19		The heart is a bloom shoots up through the stony ground. There's no room, no space to rent in this town. You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care. The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere. You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place. Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace. It's a beautiful day. Sky falls, you feel like, it's a beautiful day. Don't let it get away. You're on the road, but you've got no destination. You're in the mud in the maze of her imagination. You love this town even if that doesn't ring true. You've been all over, and it's been all over you. It's a beautiful day. Don't let it get away. It's a beautiful day. Touch me, take me to that other place. Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case. See the world in green and blue. See China right in front of you. See the canyons broken by cloud. See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out. See the Bedouin fires at night. See the oil fields at first light and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth. After the flood, all the colors came out. It was a beautiful day. Don't let it get away, beautiful day. Touch me, take me to that other place. Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case. What you don't have, you don't need it now. What you don't know, you can feel it somehow. What you don't have, you don't need it now, don't need it now. Was a beautiful day.	8
12799	Radar Love	Golden Earring	Sheila & Lyndal	05.27.89		I’ve been driving all night, my hand’s wet on the wheel. There’s a voice in my head that drives my heel. It’s my baby calling says, "I need you here." And it’s half past four, and I’m shifting gear. When she’s lonely, and the longing gets too much. She sends a cable coming in from above. Don’t need no phone at all. We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love. We’ve got a wave in the air, radar love. The radio’s playing some forgotten song, Brenda Lee’s, "Coming on Strong." The road has got me hypnotized, and I’m speeding into a new sunrise. When I get lonely, and I’m sure I’ve had enough. She sends her comfort coming in from above. Don’t need no letter at all. We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love. We’ve got a line in the sky, radar love. No more speed, I’m almost there. Gotta keep cool now gotta take care. Last car to pass, here I go, and the line of cars drove down real slow. And the radio played that forgotten song, Brenda Lee’s, "Coming on Strong." And the newsman sang his same song. One more radar love is gone. When I get lonely, and I’m sure I’ve had enough. She sends her comfort coming in from above. Don’t need no letter at all. We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love. We’ve got a line in the sky radar love. We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love. We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love.	7.5

12806	Love, Me	Collin Raye	Shawn & Mary	04.09.94		I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three. Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me. He said, "Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago, grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your grandma so." We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together. Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever. But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead, I found this letter, and this is what it said: If you get there before I do, don't give up on me. I'll meet you when my chores are through; I don't know how long I'll be. But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see. And between now and then, till I see you again, I'll be loving you. Love, me. I read those words just hours before my grandma passed away, in the doorway of a church where me and grandpa stopped to pray. I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years. But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears. If you get there before I do, don't give up on me. I'll meet you when my chores are through I don't know how long I'll be. But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see. And between now and then, till I see you again. I'll be loving you. Love, me. Between now and then, till I see you again. I'll be loving you.

12830	That's What She Gets For Loving Me	Brooks & Dunn	Thomas & Vickie	10.21.06		She said, what she wants is a man to be faithful. A true heart somebody willin' and able to stay by her side through thick and thin. A tender touch every now and then. She's not hung up on fairy tales or some dream at the bottom of a wishin' well. Fancy cars or diamond rings what she wants most are the little things. That's what she gets, that's what she gets, that's what she gets for loving me. At times I lay awake at night stare at her laying by my side, knowin' there in her heart as she sleeps. She can forever count on me.

12832	As Time Goes By	Frank Sinatra	Pauline & Shelly	02.20.00		You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh. The fundamental things apply as time goes by. And when two lovers woo, they still say, "I love you." On that, you can rely no matter what the future brings. As time goes by, moonlight and love songs, never out of date, hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate, woman needs man, and man must have his mate. That no one can deny it's still the same old story, a fight for love, and glory, a case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by. It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by.	12

12844	The Book Of Love	Peter Gabriel	Nicholas & Deane	05.13.06		The book of love is long and boring. No one can lift the damn thing. It's full of charts and facts and figures and instructions for dancing. But I, I love it when you read to me. And you, you can read me anything. The book of love has music in it. In fact, that's where music comes from. Some of it is just transcendental, some of it is just really dumb. But I, I love it when you sing to me. And you, you can sing me anything. The book of love is long and boring and written very long ago. It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes. And things we're all too young to know. But I, I love it when you give me things.

I prayed I'd find my heaven, then all my prayers came true. No, I never saw a miracle. I was blind, but now I see the miracle is the love you give to me. Seen a flower bloom and a man walk on the moon, but I never seemed to find sweet inspiration. Seen the stars fall from the sky and heard a newborn baby cry.

No, I never saw a miracle. I was blind, but now I see the miracle is the love you give to me. I've never been a winner and God knows I'm a sinner, but I found my salvation in you.

12846	I See The Light	Mandy Moore & Zachary Levi	Brandon & Ryleigh	08.01.20	client purchased 2 canvas in 1 order form	All those days watching from the windows. All those years outside looking in. All that time, never even knowing, just how blind I've been. Now, I'm here blinking in the starlight. Now, I'm here suddenly, I see. Standing here, it's all so clear, I'm where I'm meant to be. And at last, I see the light, and it's like the fog has lifted. And at last, I see the light, and it's like the sky is new. And it's warm and real and bright. And the world has somehow shifted.

I was falling fast, felt like the perfect fit, and from our first kiss, there was just no turning back. Wondering how long this step would last.

12873	The Way We Were	Barbra Streisand	Chris & Kim	06.16.90		Memories light the corners of my mind. Misty water-colored memories of the way we were. Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind. Smiles, we gave to one another for the way we were. Can it be that it was all so simple then? Or has time rewritten every line? If we had the chance to do it all again. Tell me, would we? Could we? Memories may be beautiful, and yet what's too painful to remember. We simply choose to forget. So it's the laughter we will remember. Whenever we remember. The way we were. The way we were.	12.5
12875	The Dance	Garth Brooks	Dwayne & Kimberly	07.04.92		Looking back on the memory of the dance we shared beneath the stars above, for a moment all the world was right. How could I have known you'd ever say goodbye? And now I'm glad I didn't know, the way it all would end, the way it all would go. Our lives are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain. But I'd have to miss the dance. Holding you I held, everything, for a moment wasn't I the king? But if I'd only known how the king would fall. Hey, who's to say you know I might have changed it all. And now I'm glad I didn't know the way it all would end, the way it all would go. Our lives are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain. But I'd of had to miss the dance. Yes, my life is better left to chance. I could have missed the pain, but I'd of had to miss the dance.	10.5

We've got a lifetime to share, so much to say, and as we go from day today, I'll feel you close to me, but time alone will tell. Let's take a lifetime to say I knew you well.

Just as the four walls close me within, my eyes are woken up with pure sunlight. I'm the first to know. My dearest friends, even if your hope has burned with time, anything that's dead shall be re-grown. And your vicious pain, your warning sign, you will be fine. Hey, oh, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin. Any type of love it will be shown like every single tree reached for the sky. If you're gonna fall, I'll let you know that I will pick you up, like you for I. I felt this thing I can't replace where everyone was working for this goal. Where all the children left without a trace, only to come back, as pure as gold. To recite this all? Hey, oh, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin tonight. Hey, oh, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin, tonight. Hello, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin. I cannot live. I can't breathe unless you do this with me.

Still, it's a real good bet the best is yet to come. Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine? You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine. Wait 'til the warm-up's underway. Wait 'til our lips have met, and wait 'til you see that sunshine day. You ain't seen nothin' yet. The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine? Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine. Come the day you're mine. I'm gonna teach you to fly. We've only tasted the wine. We're gonna drain the cup dry. Wait 'til your charms are right for these arms to surround. You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground. Wait 'til you're locked in my embrace. Wait 'til I draw you near. Wait 'til you see that sunshine place, ain't nothin' like it here. The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine? The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine. Come the day you're mine, and you're gonna be mine.	9

12951	18th Floor Balcony	Blue October	Jeremy & Gillian	10.10.15		I close my eyes, and I smile knowing that everything is alright to the core, so close that door, is this happening? My breath is on your hair. I'm unaware that you opened the blinds, and let the city in. God, you held my hand, and we stand just taking in everything. And I knew it from the start, so my arms are open wide. Your head is on my stomach, and we're, we're trying so hard not to fall asleep. Here we are on this 18th-floor balcony. We're both flying away. So we talked about mom's and dad's about family pasts. Just getting to know where we came from. Our hearts were on display for all to see. I can't believe this is happening to me. And I raised my hand as if to show you that I was yours. That I was so yours for the taking, I'm so yours for the taking. That's when I felt the wind pick up, I grabbed the rail while choking up these words to say, and then you kissed me. I knew it from the start, my arms are open wide. Your head is on my stomach, and we're, we're trying so hard not to fall asleep. Here we are on this 18th-floor balcony. We're both, flying away and I'll try to sleep to keep you in my dreams 'til I can bring you home with me. I'll try to sleep, and when I do, I'll keep you in my dreams.

I knew it from the start, so my arms are open wide. Your head is on my stomach. No, we're not going to sleep, sleep. Here we are on this 18th-floor balcony. We're both flying away.	7

12957	Golden	Lady Antebellum	Tom & Vickie	30.10.14		The sunset falls in Wichita, yellow dances through the blue. Wheatfields catch a glimpse of heaven, makes me think of you. And even when you're miles away, you're always on my mind. Lord knows you're in my heart even when I close my eyes. You are golden, precious as a prayer. Flying up through the air while the rain is falling. Golden, timeless as a kiss. Baby, I don't wanna miss another perfect moment to tell you how you make me feel. The day you strolled in, my heart was stolen, 'cause you are golden. Smallest parts of who you are, are everything to me. From the way you laugh to the way you cry, to the way you love on me. Shadows run, and darkness fades when you come around. My single star amongst the gray always shining down. Yeah, you are golden, precious as a prayer. Flying up through the air while the rain is falling. Golden, timeless as a kiss. Baby, I don't wanna miss another perfect moment to tell you how you make me feel.

Practiced are my sins, never, gonna let me win. Under everything, just another human being, I don't wanna hurt. There's so much in this world to make me bleed. Stay with me, you're all I see. Did I say that I need you? Did I say that I want you? Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see. No one knows this more than me.

12964	Better Together	Jack Johnson	Adam & Joan	06.07.08		There is no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard. No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart. Our dreams, and they are made out of real things like a shoe box of photographs with sepia-toned loving. Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart like, "why are we here?" and, "where do we go?" and, "how come it's so hard?" It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving. I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together. It's always better when we're together. Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together. Well, it's always better when we're together. Yeah, it's always better when we're together. And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight. But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings and brings new things. For tomorrow night you see that they'll be gone too. Too many things I have to do. But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene, I'd be under the impression. I was somewhere in between with only two: just me and you. Not so many things we got to do, or places we got to be. We'll sit beneath the mango tree now. Yeah, it's always better when we're together. We're somewhere in between together. Well, it's always better when we're together. Yeah, it's always better when we're together. I believe in memories. They look so, so pretty when I sleep. Hey now, and when I wake up, you look so pretty sleeping next to me. But there is not enough time, and there is no, no song I could sing. And there is no combination of words I could say. But I will still tell you one thing - we're better together.	7
12968	I'll Always Be Right There	Bryan Adams	Matt & Carina	07.18.98		I swear to you I will always be there for you. There's nothin' I won't do. I promise you all my life, I will live for you. We will make it through, forever. We will be together you and me. Mm, when I hold you, nothin' can compare. With all of my heart, you know I'll always be right there.

Forever we will be together a family. The more I get to know ya nothin' can compare. With all of my heart, you know I'll always be right there. Forever we will be together just you and me.

12969	Remember When	Alan Jackson	Chuck & Terri	07.07.73		Remember when, I was young and so were you, and time stood still, and love was all we knew. You were the first, so was I, we made love and then you cried, remember when. Remember when, we vowed the vows and walked the walk, gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard. We lived and learned, life threw curves, there was joy, there was hurt, remember when. Remember when, old ones died and new were born, and life was changed, disassembled, rearranged. We came together, fell apart, and broke each other's hearts, remember when. Remember when, the sound of little feet was the music we danced to week to week, brought back the love, we found trust, vowed we'd never give it up, remember when. Remember when, thirty seemed old.  Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone, to where we are, where we've been, said we'd do it all again, remember when. Remember when, we said when we turned gray, when the children grow up and move away, we won't be sad, we'll be glad, for all the life we've had, and we'll remember when, remember when, remember when.	9
12971	You Decorated My Life	Kenny Rogers	Don & Judi	06.13.81		All my life was a paper once plain, pure, and white. 'Til you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then. 'Til the balance was right then you added some music, every note was in place. And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face. And you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part. And you, decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart, you decorated my life. Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song. There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me until you came along. And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise. Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes. And you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part. And you, decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart, you decorated my life.	10
12973	Suitcase	Steve Moakler	Eric & Tricia	11.15.13		Everybody wants a house on the hill. Everybody wants a skiboat. Everybody wants a big promotion at the end of the year. Everybody wants a swimming pool in a big back yard. A little more vacation and a brand new car. But I'd be fine watching you watch the sun go down with your head on my chest, and a blanket on the ground. 'Cause everybody wants to chase the rainbow and find a pot of gold hoping there's a suitcase full of money. But all I want is you, honey, yeah. It'd be pretty cool if I could buy you anything you wanted. And if we won the lottery, no, I wouldn't complain. We all want something that we lost back. Wish we could make a few changes to the past. But when I'm with you, baby, I only want one thing. I'd be fine watching you watch the sun go down with your head on my chest, and a blanket on the ground. 'Cause everybody wants to chase the rainbow and find a pot of gold hoping there's a suitcase full of money. But all I want is you, honey. If I had one more time to make you smile, that's what Id do. 'Cause I'm betting it all, girl, I could prove it to you. I'd be fine watching you watch the sun go down with your head on my chest, and a blanket on the ground. 'Cause everybody wants to chase the rainbow and find a pot of gold hoping there's a suitcase full of money. But all I want is you, honey.	8
12976	My Heart Will Go On	Celine Dion	Kevin & Tara	06.05.04		Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you that is how I know you go on. Far, across the distance, and spaces between us. You have come to show you go on. Near, far wherever you are, I believe that the heart does go on. Once more, you open the door, and you're here in my heart, and my heart will go on and on. Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime. And never let go 'til we're gone. Love was when I loved you, one true time I'd hold to. In my life, we'll always go on. Near, far wherever you are, I believe that the heart does go on. Once more, you open the door, and you're here in my heart, and my heart will go on and on. You're here, there's nothing I fear, and I know that my heart will go on. We'll stay, forever this way, you are safe in my heart, and my heart will go on and on.	10
12977	A Different Corner	George Michael	Tim & Brandi	01.14.92		I'd say love was a magical thing. I'd say love would keep us from pain. Had I been there? Had I been there? I would promise you all of my life. But to lose you would cut like a knife, so I don't dare. No, I don't dare. 'Cause I've never come close in all of these years, you are the only one to stop my tears. And I'm so scared. I'm so scared. Take me back in time, maybe I can forget. Turn a different corner, and we never would have met. Would you care? I don't understand it, for you, it's a breeze. Little by little, you've brought me to my knees. Don't you care? No, I've never come close in all of these years, you are the only one to stop my tears. I'm so scared of this love. And if all that there is, is this fear of being used. I should go back to being lonely and confused. If I could, I would, I swear. Whoa, I swear.	10
12986	These Arms Of Mine	Otis Redding	Michael & Veronica	03.03.03		These arms of mine, they are lonely. Lonely and feeling blue. These arms of mine, they are yearning, yearning from wanting you. And if you would let them hold you, oh, how grateful I will be. These arms of mine, they are burning. Burning from wanting you. These arms of mine, they are wanting. Wanting to hold you and if you would let them hold you. Oh, how grateful I will be. Come on, come on, baby, just be my little woman. Just be my lover, oh. I need me, somebody, somebody to treat me right, oh. I need your arms, loving arms to hold me tight. And I, I, I need your, I need your tender lips to hold me. Together when I'm right with you.	12
12987	Speak Softly Love	The Godfather	Chuck & Monica	12.02.72		Speak softly love, and hold me warm against your heart. I feel your words the tender trembling moments start. We're in a world our very own, sharing a love that only few have ever known. Wine-colored days warmed by the sun. Deep velvet nights when we are one. Speak softly love, so no one hears us but the sky. The vows of love we make will live until we die. My life is yours, and all because you came into my world with love so softly love. Wine-colored days warmed by the sun. Deep velvet nights when we are one. Speak softly love, so no one hears us but the sky. The vows of love we make will live until we die. My life is yours, and all because you came into my world with love so softly love.	11
12988	Now That I Love You	David Corey	Louis & Melissa	08.12.06		Thought I was in love before never knew that there was more. Saw the world in black and white until you came into my life. Suddenly before my eyes, there's a rainbow in the sky reaching out and telling me that it's you I need. Now that I love you, I know that I never, never, loved anyone before you, cause this is so real. Now that I found you, I know I could never, never, live my life without you. Now that I love you. I was taken by surprise all at once, I realized, how your love completed me.  And how you are my destiny. You've become the air I breathe. You're nothing less than everything. You're in my heart and in my soul. You have made me whole. Now that I love you, I know that I never, never, loved anyone before you, (I never loved anyone) cause this is so real. Now that I found you, I know I could never, never, live my life without you. (Never without you) Now that I love you. Never in my life have I been touched this way. I never been moved to say, "I want forever with you." Never have I wanted someone more than you. Never been closer to my heart. Now that I love you. Oooh yeah, I love you. Now that I love you (Now I love you) I know that I never, never, loved anyone before you (I never loved anyone) cause this is so real. Now that I found you, I know I could never, never, live my life without you. (Never live my life) Now that I love you. Now that I love you. I never loved anyone, now that I love you.

12992	To The Moon And Back	Luke Bryan	Jeremy & Jessica			Through the dirt and the gravel, through the years and the miles, every road that you traveled. Through the tears and the smiles. Through the clear and the muddy. Through the thick and thin. The quiet nights, the howling wind. Through the good and the ugly. The blue and the black. To the ends of the Earth, to the moon and back. Through all of the words, the mean, and the kind. Through the strings that unravel and the ties that bind. From the crazy and the different to the more of the same. From the coast is clear, to a hurricane. Yeah, I'll be right beside you on a roll or off the tracks. To the ends of the Earth, to the moon and back. To the moon and back. Through the bitter and the sweet, the cold and the fire, lonely cotton sheets, and the burning desire until our song is over. 'Til the stars all fade to black, I'm gonna love you to the ends of the Earth. To the moon and back. Yeah, I'm gonna love you, all the way, to the moon and back. To the moon and back.	10
12995	If My Heart Was A House	Owl City	Taylor & Maggie	07.13.13		You're the sky that I fell through, and I remember the view whenever I'm holding you. The sun hung from a string looking down on the world as it warms over everything. Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine, and your sighs harmonize with mine. Unmistakably, I can still feel your heartbeat fast when you dance with me. We got older, and I should have known (Do you feel alive?) that I'd feel colder when I walk alone (Oh, but you'll survive). So I may as well ditch my dismay (Bombs away. bombs away). Circle me and the needle moves gracefully. Back and forth, if my heart was a compass, you'd be North. Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall, wherever you go, if my heart was a house, you'd be home. It makes me smile because you said it best. I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the West. Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you cause your favorite shade is navy blue. I walk slowly when I'm on my own (Do you feel alive?). Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone (Oh, but you'll survive). So I may as well ditch my dismay (Bombs away, bombs away). Circle me and the needle moves gracefully. Back and forth, if my heart was a compass, you'd be North. Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall, wherever you go, if my heart was a house, you'd be home. If my heart was a house, you'd be home.	8
12996	My Kind Of Crazy	Brantley Gilbert	Greg & Megan	06.20.19		She says, "Look, baby, I'm a rock star." Grabs my old guitar playin' it upside down, dancin' around in front of our tv. I can't see the ballgame, so I just wave my lighter around and say, "Yeah, rock on baby, I'd rather watch you anyway. But when you're done, can I come backstage? And get you to sign your name on that zeppelin shirt of mine you're wearin'? I'll never wash that thing again." Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy. The little games she plays. Lord, they'll never get old. She's too cute to get on my last nerve the way she throws her little fits. Pokin' out her lip and bitin' mine when we kiss. There ain't a fight that she can't win. That's my baby, and she's my kind of crazy. You ought to see her in my pickup. She's gotta have that radio up. Bless her heart she can't sit still, head in my lap, bare feet on the windshield says, "C'mon baby, let me drive." Now, honey, it's a stick shift, remember what you did last time? Oh, yeah and she's my kind of crazy. The little games she plays. Lord, they'll never get old. She's too cute to get on my last nerve the way she throws her little fits. Pokin' out her lip and bitin' mine when we kiss. There ain't a fight that she can't win. That's my baby, and she's my kind of crazy. She never lets me rest. She keeps me up all night, known to roll me off the bed and steal the covers off my side. But I hear, "Wake up sleepy head." and I open up my eyes, and it's all worth the while. Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy. The little games she plays. Lord, they'll never get old. She's too cute to get on my last nerve the way she throws her little fits. Pokin' out her lip and bitin' mine when we kiss. There ain't a fight that she can't win. That's my baby, and she's my kind of crazy. That's my baby, and she's my kind of crazy.	7
12997	Please Keep Loving Me	James TW	 Rob & Laura	 15.04.20		I know I have my moments, and at times I'm hard to be around. I get impatient when you're getting dressed. It's just I thought the first one looked the best. You're beautiful more than I deserve. So listen close to these 1, 2, 3, 4 words. So, please keep loving me 'cause our hearts speak fluently. Wherever I go, whatever I do, the map on my heart leads to you. So baby, please keep loving me. Loving me, loving me. Your lips on my smile are like bees around a honeycomb. You see through my harsh misty windows, and out of all the fingerprints, only yours will show. You're beautiful before the make-ups on, and out of all the girls, you're the one I want. Please keep loving me 'cause our hearts speak fluently. Wherever I go, whatever I do, the map on my heart leads to you. So baby, please keep loving me. Loving me, loving me.

12998	Friends And Lovers	Incubus	Ryan & Arroya	03.06.20		I'm a ne'er do well runnin' off black and gold. It's high time I pulled over and walked around a while. I've seen that porcelain shell erect some skeleton, and I feel like we'd walk well together. Because in the end, we are friends and lovers. If asked of me, I would gobble them to bits. The things that wall us off from where we belong. What's wrong with you is good for what's wrong with me. And I think maybe we should stick together because, in the end, we are friends and lovers. We are friends and lovers. Abandon all the bold we've got to pick. They only weigh us down, and we're better than that. If they all throw stones, start a collection of everything we're not. And what's because you should never have to defend being friends and lovers. Being friends and lovers. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Being friends and lovers.	11

Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song, it's for people like you that keep it turned on.

13518	Play Me	Neil Diamond	Brian & Paula	11.27.10	2 canvas and 2 songs in 1 order form	She was moring and I was night time. I one day woke up to find her lying beside my bed. I softly said, "Come take me" for I've been lonely. In need of someone as though I'd done someone wrong somewhere, I don't know where. Come lately. You are the sun I am the moon. You are the words I am the tune, play me song. She sang to me song, she brang to me. Words that rang in me, rhyme that sprang from me warmed the night and what was right became me. You are the sun I am the moon. You are the words I am the tune, play me. And so it was that I came to travel upon a road that was thorned and narrow. Another place, another grace would save me. You are the sun, I am the moon. You are the word I am the tune, play me.	11
	God Knew That I needed You	Melodie Tunney	Mark & Krista	12.31.10		I look at you, and I see the one God chose for me. What did I do to deserve all I have received?

In spite of all you see, I know your love is true. God knew that I needed you. When we face the darkest of the night, I'll reach out for your hand and I know your love will hold me tight, till we see the sun again. For God has given me a taste of heaven here on earth, till life is through, I belong with you. My heart will fail and my weaknesses will be uncovered and love will prevail when we choose to turn to each other. And in the deepest valleys the Lord will see us through. God knew that I needed, He knew just what I needed, God knew that I needed you.	11
13543	Die A Happy Man	Thomas Rhett	Eric & Rebekah	02.22.20		Baby, last night was hands down one of the best nights that I've had, no doubt. Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye, then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain. I know that I can't even tell you enough that all I need in this life is your crazy love. If I never get to see the Northern lights or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night. If all I got is your hand in my hand, baby, I could die a happy man. A happy man, baby, baby, and that red dress bring me to my knees, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe. You're a saint. You're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece. It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams. And I know that I can't even tell you enough that all I need in this life is your crazy love. If I never get to see the Northern lights or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night. If all I got is your hand in my hand, baby, I could die a happy man. I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination. Baby, you're my great escape. We could stay at home, listen to the radio, or dance around the fireplace. If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia or drive a sports car up the coast of California. Well, if all I got is your hand in my hand, baby, I could die a happy man. Baby, I could die a happy man. I could die a happy man, you know I could, girl. I could die. I could die a happy man.	7.5

I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some, but I won't hesitate no more, no more, it cannot wait, I'm yours. Well, open up your mind and see like me. Open up your plans and damn you're free. Look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love. Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing.

It cannot wait, I'm sure there's no need to complicate our time is short, this is our fate, I'm yours. I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror and bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer. But my breath fogged up the glass, and so I drew a new face, and I laughed. I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason to rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons. It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue. But I won't hesitate, no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours. Well, open up your mind and see like me. Open up your plans and damn you're free. Look into your heart, and you'll find the sky is yours. So please, don't please, don't please don't, there's no need to complicate. 'Cause our time is short.

13559	More Than Words	Extreme	James & Kate	02.20.05		Saying "I love you" is not the words I want to hear from you. It's not that I want you, not to say, but if you only knew how easy it would be to show me how you feel. More than words is all you have to do to make it real. Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, 'cause I'd already know. What would you do, if my heart was torn in two? More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real. What would you say if I took those words away? Then you couldn't make things new just by saying "I love you." More than words now, but I've tried to talk to you, and make you understand. All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hands, and touch me, hold me close, don't ever let me go. More than words is all I ever needed you to show, then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, 'cause I'd already know. What would you do, if my heart was torn in two? More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real. What would you say if I took those words away, when you couldn't make things new just by saying "I love you." More than words, more than words, more than words, more than words, more than words...	8.5

And I'll always need you. And if you ever change your mind, I'll still, I will love you. I wish you'd never left me, but love's a mystery. You can break a heart so easily. Oh, the days and nights reveal how much I feel for you. Time has come for me to see how much your love has meant to me. And I'll always need you.

13565	Open My Eyes	40 Watt Sun	Chase & Ashley	09.18.18		The places we've been to these past seven years seem so far. And the way that we came to be here, where we are, seemed so hard. And maybe I'm not in my right to long for peace in your eyes, but baby, I know you're not right. If only the love that you'd feel for me, you'd feel for you. You made it easy for me to give myself up. You waited, you leaned out for me, and you never changed, did you, my love? And after the pain came a peace. Then a happiness like we've never known. So help me to help you and say for me, after all, that you did for me, what can I do? I could find a way. I would do anything, and I would never let you go. Open my eyes and let me see you shining. And maybe, one move at a time, you'd learn to love yourself again. I'd take you in my longing arms and try forever. Please be happy, my love. And all of the pain in your life, I'd make it better. And all that you do, I'd make it matter. Matter to me and to you. And in my way, I've only tried to love you more. I opened everything, now open your eyes. Can you see me shining?	9

But I love the way you love me, strong and wild, slow and easy, heart and soul so completely. I love the way you love me. I like to imitate old Jerry Lee and watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off key and I like the innocent way that you cry at sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times. But I love the way you love me, strong and wild, slow and easy, heart and soul so completely. I love the way you love me and I could list a million things. I love to like about you but they all come down to one reason, I could never live without you. I love the way you love me, strong and wild, slow and easy, heart and soul so completely.

13571	Catch The Wind	Donovan	Ed & Janice	12.21.69		In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty, I want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind. To feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand. Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. When sundown pales the sky, I want to hide a while behind your smile. And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find for me to love you now. Would be the sweetest thing that would make me sing. Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind when rain has hung the leaves with tears. I want you near to kill my fears, to help me to leave all my blues behind. For standin' in your heart is where I want to be, and I long to be. Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.	11
13572	In My Life	Jake Shimabukuro	Rus & Christine	10.20.18		There are places I'll remember. All my life though some have changed. Some forever, not for better, some have gone, and some remain. All these places had their moments with lovers and friends I still can recall. Some are dead, and some are living. In my life, I've loved them all. But of all these friends, and lovers there is no one compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning when I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection, for people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life, I'll love you more. Though, I know I'll never lose affection, for people, and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life, I'll love you more.	10
13573	You're The Best Thing	Style Council	Brian & Laurie	09.12.92		Oh no, I could be discontent and chase the rainbow's end. I might win much more, but lose all that is mine. I could be a lot, but I know I'm not. I'm content just with the riches that you bring. Oh, I might shoot to win and commit the sin of wanting more than I've already got. I could run away, but I'd rather stay in the warmth of your smile lighting up my day. The one that makes me say, "'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world. Oooh, you're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away." I might be a king and steal my peoples' things, but I don't go for that power crazy way. All that I could rule, I don't check for fools. All that I need is to be left to live my way. So listen to what I say, "'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world. You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away." About the soul of me, baby, you're the best for me. You color up my dreams by taking chance from me.

You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away. You're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world. Hey, baby, you're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away.

Then one to share my hopes and dreams and build my life upon. I'll give everything I have to give until my time on earth is done. It was you that changed my life.

13587	My Little Girl	Tim McGraw	Samara	12.26.93		Gotta hold on easy as I let you go going to tell you how much I love you. Though you think you already know, I remember I thought you looked like an angel. Wrapped in pink, so soft and warm, you've had me wrapped around your finger. Since the day you were born, you're beautiful baby from the outside in. Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again. Go on, take on this old world but to me you know you'll always be my little girl. When you were in trouble that crooked little smile, could melt my heart of stone. Now look at you, I turned around and you've almost grown. Sometimes when you're asleep I whisper I love you. In the moonlight at your door as I walk away I hear you say, “Daddy love you more”. You're beautiful baby from the outside in. Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again. Go on, take on this old world but to me you know you'll always be my little girl. Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand but I won't say yes to him unless I know he's the half that makes you whole. He has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man. I know he'll say that he's in love but between you and me, he won't be good enough. You're beautiful baby from the outside in. Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again. Go on, take on this old world but to me you know you'll always be my little girl.	7.5

In this life, I was loved by you. For every mountain I have climbed, every Raging river crossed. You were the treasure I longed to find. Without your love I would be lost, let the world stop turning, let the sun stop burning. Let them tell me love's not worth going through. If it all falls apart, I will know deep in my heart.

DANIELS BATCH							#N/A
	Love Me Like Jesus Does	Eric Church				I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl. I'm a back-row sinner at a tent revival. But she believes in me like she believes her Bible and loves me like Jesus does. I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy. I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee. But she carries me when my sins make me heavy and love me like Jesus does. All the crazy in my dreams, both my broken wings, every single piece of everything I am. Yeah, she knows the man I ain't. She forgives me when I can't. The devil man, no, he don't stand a chance 'cause she loves me like Jesus does. I always thought she'd give up on me one day. Wash her hands off me, leave me staring down some runway. But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday that she loves me like Jesus does. All the crazy in my dreams, and both my broken wings, every single piece of who I am. Yeah, she knows the man I ain't. She forgives me when I can't. And the devil man, no, he don't have a prayer 'cause she loves me like Jesus does. Yes, she knows the man I ain't. She forgives me when I can't. That devil man, he don't stand a chance. She loves me like Jesus does. I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl.	8

A girl like you should never look so blue (blue). You're everything I see in my dreams. I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true (true). Treasure that is what you are, honey, you're my golden star. You know you can make my wish come true. If you let me treasure you. If you let me treasure, oh, oh, oh. You are my treasure.

	God made you (with me in mind)	Brent Lamb				Like the bees made honey, and the grapes made wine. God made you with me in mind. Like the sun goes down so the moon can shine. God made you with me in mind. First time I saw you, honey, I knew you were meant for me, and I was meant for you. On the day, I took your hand in mine. I knew God made you with me in mind. Like the southern breeze, to the Georgia vines. God made you with me in mind. Like a country song, to Patsy Cline. God made you with me in mind. First time I saw you, honey, I knew you were meant for me, and I was meant for you. On the day, I took your hand in mine. I knew God made you with me in mind. Like Tarzan swingin' in only vine. Like an old jukebox with one ping done. Like a wedding day, when a church bells chimes. First time I saw you, honey, I knew you were meant for me, and I was meant for you. On the day, I took your hand in mine. I knew God made you with me in mind. God made you with me in mind.	9
	You Were Meant For Me	Gene Kelly				Life was a song you came along. I've laid awake the whole night through. If I ever dared to think you cared, this is what I'd say to you, "You were meant for me, and I was meant for you. Nature patterned you, and when she was done, you were all the sweet things rolled up in one. You're like a plaintive melody that never lets me free, but I'm content the angels must have sent you. And they meant you just for me. But I'm content the angels must have sent you. And they meant you just for me."	14
	Sherry	Frankie Valli				Sherry, Sherry, baby. Sherry, Sherry, baby. Sherry, baby (Sherry, baby), baby (Sherry, baby). Sherry, can you come out tonight? Sherry, baby (Sherry, baby).

	For My Wedding	Don Henley				For my wedding, I will dress in black and never again will I look back. Ah, my dark angels, we must part for I've made a sanctuary of my heart. To want what I have, to take what I'm given with grace, for this, I pray on my wedding day. For my wedding, I don't want violins or sentimental songs about thick and thin. I want a moment of silence, and a moment of prayer, for the love we'll need to make it in the world out there. To want what I have, to take what I'm given with grace, for this, I pray on my wedding day. On my wedding day. I dream, and my dreams are all glory and light. That's what I've wanted for my life and if it hasn't always been that way. Well, I can dream, and I can pray on my wedding day. So what makes us any different from all the others who have tried and failed before us. Maybe nothing, maybe nothing at all. But I pray, we're the lucky ones, I pray we never fall. To want what we have, to take what we're given with grace, for these things, I pray on my wedding day. On my wedding day.	9
	Can I Keep You	Phil Roebuck				Hold my hand fast to sleep. Give me your master key. Ohh, baby, can I keep you? Lean your head back to kiss, throw my arms up into this. Ooh, baby, can I keep you? Wake me up if you are able. Let's have our breakfast at your kitchen table in the morning. Ohh, can I keep you? I walk you up and down your street. Take me home, bury me deep in your sheets. Ohh, baby, can I keep you? Some men got money, and some men got charm, but I ain't got nothing without you on my arm. Ohh, baby, can I keep you? In come the breakers I'm riding the crest, I lie like a prince on your warm mother breast. And when I pass by the saints in their frozen stone gowns. They wink like they know me and what I have found. Ohh, baby, can I keep you?	11
	 Lost without you	Freya Ridings				Standing on the platform watching you go. It's like no other pain I've ever known. To love someone so much, to have no control, you said, "I wanna see the world," and I said, "Go." I think I'm lost without you, I just feel crushed, without you. I've been strong for so long that I never thought how much I needed you. I think I'm lost without you. Strangers, rushing past just trying to get home, but you were the only safe haven that I've known. Hits me at full speed, feels like I can't breathe, and nobody knows this pain inside me. My world is crumbling. I should never have let you go. I think I'm lost without you. I think I'm lost, lost, lost. Ooh, ooh, ooh, I think I'm lost without you, you. I just feel crushed without you. 'Cause I've been strong for so long that I never thought how much I love you. Standing on the platform watching you go, you said, "I wanna see the world," and I said, "Go."	10
	One call away	Charlie Puth				I'm only one call away. I'll be there to save the day. Superman got nothing on me. I'm only one call away. Call me, baby.

	The Valentine Song	Justin Young				Every other sight I’ve seen, no other smile can seem to move me like you. I don’t know if you’ve noticed me, but I’m the man who’s heart you’re holding onto. And on this occasion, there’s one thing I’ve got to say, “Will you be my Valentine? I have been waiting, Cupid’s been aiming. Will you share this heart of mine? Forever’s a ways, yeah. Let’s start with today then.” Every other day like this has always seem to lose its meaning on me. But this year, I just can’t resist, 'cause you’re the reason that I see things differently. I wanna tell you so much, but I thought I’d say it in this way, this way, “Will you be my Valentine? I have been waiting, Cupid’s been aiming. Will you share this heart of mine? Forever’s a ways, yeah. Let’s start with today then.” Cards and candy-covered hearts. Flowers that I’d bring to you. I will sing to you full attention from the start. I’ll show you how a love should feel if you say you will. “Will you be my Valentine? I have been waiting, Cupid’s been aiming. Will you share this heart of mine? Forever’s a ways, yeah. Let’s start with today then. Will you be my Valentine? I have been waiting, Cupid’s been aiming. Will you share this heart of mine? Forever’s a ways, yeah. Let’s start with today then."	8

It's been a while. God, it's good to see you smile. I see you reaching for your keys, looking for a reason not to leave. If you don't know if you should stay. If you don't say what's on your mind. Baby, just breathe, there's nowhere else tonight we should be. You wanna make a memory? I dug up this old photograph look at all that hair we had. It's bittersweet to hear you laugh. Your phone is ringin'. I don't wanna ask. If you go now I'll understand, if you stay, hey, I've gotta plan. You wanna make a memory? You wanna steal a piece of time? You can sing the melody to me, and I can write a couple lines. You wanna make a memory? If you don't know if you should stay and you don't say what's on your mind. Baby, just breathe, there's nowhere else tonight we should be, we should be. You wanna make a memory? You wanna steal a piece of time? You can sing the melody to me, and I can write a couple lines.

	Time Stand Still	The Band Rush				I turn my back to the wind to catch my breath before I start off again, driven on without a moment to spend, to pass an evening with a drink and a friend. I let my skin get too thin. I'd like to pause no matter what I pretend. Like some pilgrim who learns to transcend, learns to live as if each step was the end. (Time stand still) I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now. (Time stand still) See more of the people and the places that surround me now. Time stand still. Freeze this moment a little bit longer, make each sensation a little bit stronger. Experience slips away. Experience slips away. Time stand still. I turn my face to the sun close my eyes let my defenses down. All those wounds that I can't get unwound. I let my past go too fast, no time to pause. If I could slow it all down like some captain whose ship runs aground, I can wait until the tide comes around. (Time stand still) I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now. (Time stand still) See more of the people and the places that surround me now. Freeze this moment a little bit longer. Make each sensation a little bit stronger. Make each impression a little bit stronger. Freeze this motion a little bit longer. The innocence slips away. The innocence slips away. Time stand still, time stand still. I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now. See more of the people and the places that surround me now. Time stand still. Summer's going fast, nights growing colder. Children growing up, old friends growing older. Freeze this moment a little bit longer. Make each sensation a little bit stronger. Experience slips away. Experience slips away. The innocence slips away.	7

	Eleanor Rigby	The Beatles				I look at all the lonely people. I look at all the lonely people. Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been. Lives in a dream, waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for? All the lonely people. Where do they all come from? All the lonely people. Where do they all belong? Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear no one comes near. Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there. What does he care? All the lonely people. Where do they all come from? All the lonely people. Where do they all belong? Ah, look at all the lonely people. Ah, look at all the lonely people. Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name. Nobody came. Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave. No one was saved. All the lonely people. Where do they all come from? All the lonely people. Where do they all belong?	9
	Would You Go With Me	Josh Turner				Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire? Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher? If we roll from town to town and never shut it down. Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover? Would we walk even closer until the trip was over? And would it be okay if I didn't know the way? If I gave you my hand, would you take it? And make me the happiest man in the world? If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl. Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea? Let me know if you're really a dream. I love you so, so would you go with me? Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together? Could you not look down forever if you were lighter than a feather. Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me? If I gave you my hand, would you take it? And make me the happiest man in the world? If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl. Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea? Help me tie up the ends of a dream. I gotta know, would you go with me? I love you so, so would you go with me?	8
	Cowboys and Angels	Garth Brooks				On the eighth day, God noticed a problem for there below Him stood a cowboy alone, stubborn and proud, reckless and loud. God knew he'd never make it on his own, so God looked out all over creation and listened as that cowboy prayed. God took passion, and thunder, patience, and wonder, then He sent down the best thing that God ever made. Cowboys and angels, leather and lace, salt of the earth meets heavenly grace. Cowboys and angels tested and tried it's a long way to heaven and one hell of a ride. Nothin's changed since the dawn of creation, for you will find them together today. And only heaven above them knows why she loves him, but he must be the reason she don't fly away. Cowboys and angels, leather and lace, salt of the earth meets heavenly grace. Cowboys and angels tested and tried it's a long way to heaven and one hell of a ride. It's a long way to heaven and one hell of a ride.	9

	Here on out	Dave Matthew's Band				Out of the corner of my eye, I caught you walk by I chase you down. Is it okay if I call you mine? From here on out? As if I could ever stop, you are light as a butterfly, as heavy as a rock, the bottom, and the top. Is it okay if I call you mine? From here on out? As if I could ever stop, and now I'm opened up.

Babe, I got you, babe. I got you, babe. They say our love won't pay the rent. Before it's earned our money's all been spent. I guess that's so we don't have a plot, but at least I'm sure of all the things we got, babe. I got you, babe. I got you, babe. I got flowers in the spring. I got you to wear my ring, and when I'm sad, you're a clown. And if I get scared you're always around. Don't let them say your hairs’ too long 'cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong.

	Flying Without Wings	Westlife				Everybody's looking for that something, one thing that makes it all complete. You find it in the strangest places. Places you never knew it could be. Some find it in the face of their children. Some find it in their lover's eyes. Who can deny the joy it brings? When you found that special thing, you're flying without wings. Some find it sharing every morning. Some in their solitary lives, you find it in the words of others. A simple line can make you laugh or cry. You find it in the deepest friendship. The kind you cherish all your life and when you know how much that means. You've found that special thing, you're flying without wings. So impossible as they may seem, you've got to fight for every dream. 'Cause who's to know which one you let go. Would have made you complete. Well, for me, it's waking up beside you to watch the sunrise on your face. To know that I can say I love you, in any given time or place its little things that only I know. Those are the things that make you mine, and it's like flying without wings. 'Cause you're my special thing, I'm flying without wings. And you're the place my life begins, and you'll be where it ends. I'm flying without wings. And that's the joy you bring. I'm flying without wings.	8
	Wave on Wave	Pat Green				Mile upon mile, got no direction. We're all playin' the same game. We're all lookin' for redemption. Just to pray, to say the name. So caught up now in pretendin' that what we're seekin' is the truth. I'm just lookin' for a happy endin'. All I'm lookin' for is you. You came upon me, wave on wave. You're the reason I'm still here, yeah. Am I the one you were sent to save? You came upon me, wave on wave. I wandered out into the water. An' I thought that I might drown.

	Familiar taste of poison	Halestorm				"Drink the wine, my darling," you said, "Take your time and consume all of it." But the roses were only to drain my inspiration. The promises were spoiled before they left your lips. And I breathe you in again just to feel you underneath my skin. Holding on to the sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison. I tell myself that you're no good for me. I wish you well, but desire never leaves. I could fight this till the end, but maybe I don't want to win. I breathe you in again just to feel you underneath my skin. Holding on to the sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison. I don't wanna be saved. I don't wanna be sober. I want you on my mind, in my dreams behind these eyes. And I won't wake up, no not this time. I breathe you in again just to feel you underneath my skin. Holding on to the sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison. A familiar taste of poison. A familiar taste of poison.	9
	Romeo and Juliet	Dire Straits				A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade laying everybody low with a love song that he made. Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade, says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?" Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo. You nearly gimme a heart attack." He's underneath the window she's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that. Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?" Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start, and I bet, when you exploded into my heart. And I forget, I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet? Come up, on different streets, they both were streets of shame. Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same. And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals? Well, you can fall for chains of silver. You can fall for chains of gold. You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold. You promised me everything. You promised me thick and thin, yeah. Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him." Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry, you said, "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die." There's a place, for us, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Julie? I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV. And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you. I can't do anything except be in love with you. And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat and the bad company. And all I do is kiss you, through the bars, of a rhyme. Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time. Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry, you said, "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die." There's a place, for us, you know the movie song.

	You and Me	You & Me				You and me were always with each other before we knew the other was ever there. You and me, we belong together, just like a breath needs the air. I told you if you called, I would come runnin' across the highs, the lows, and the in-betweens. You and me, we've got two minds that think as one, and our hearts march to the same beat. They say everything, it happens for a reason. You can be flawed enough, but perfect for a person, someone who will be there for you when you fall apart, guiding your direction when you're riding through the dark. Oh, that's you and me. You and me, we're searching for the same light. Desperate for a cure to this disease. Well, some days are better than others, but I fear no thing as long as you're with me.

	If tomorrow never comes	Garth Brooks				Sometimes late at night, I lie awake and watch her sleeping. She's lost in peaceful dreams. So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark. And the thought crosses my mind if I never wake up in the morning. Would she ever doubt the way I feel about her in my heart? If tomorrow never comes, will she know how much I loved her? Did I try in every way to show her every day that she's my only one? And if my time on earth were through, and she must face this world without me is the love I gave her in the past, gonna be enough to last? If tomorrow never comes. 'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life who never knew how much I loved them. Now I live with the regret that my true feelings for them never were revealed. So I made a promise to myself to say each day how much she means to me. And avoid that circumstance where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel. 'Cause if tomorrow never comes, will she know how much I loved her? Did I try in every way to show her every day that she's my only one? And if my time on earth were through, and she must face this world without me is the love I gave her in the past, gonna be enough to last? If tomorrow never comes. So tell that someone that you love just what you're thinking of. If tomorrow never comes.	8
	You Ruined Everything	Jonathan Coulton				I was fine. I pulled myself together just in time to throw myself away. Once my perfect world was gone, I knew you ruined everything in the nicest way. You should know how great things were before you. Even so, they're better still today. I can't think of who I was before you ruined everything in the nicest way. Bumps in the road remind us the worst of the best behind us. Only good things will find us, me and you. Days will be clear and sunny. We're gonna need more money. Baby, you know it's funny, all those stories coming true despite my better efforts it's all for you. The worst kind of cliche, I'll be with you till the day you leave. You ruined everything in the nicest way.	12
	From The Ground Up	Dan & Shay				Grandma and grandpa painted a picture of sixty-five years and one little house. More than a memory, more than saying I do. Kiss you goodnight's and I love you's. Me and you baby, walk in the footsteps. Build our own family one day at a time. Ten little toes, a painted pink room. Our beautiful baby looks just like you. And we'll build this love from the ground up. Now, 'til forever it's all of me, all of you. Just take my hand and I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be. And we'll build this love from the ground up for worse or for better. And I will be all you need. Beside you, I'll stand through the good and the bad. We'll give all that we have, and we'll build this love from the ground up. This life will go by in the blink of an eye. But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side. The cloud are gonna roll, the earth's gonna shake. But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain. And we'll build this love from the ground up. Now, 'til forever it's all of me, all of you. Just take my hand, and I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be. And we'll build this love from the ground up for worse or for better. And I will be all you need. Beside you, I'll stand through the good and the bad. We'll give all that we have, and we'll build this love from the ground up. Someday we'll wake up with thousands of pictures. Sixty-five years in this little house, I won't trade for nothing, the life that we built. I'll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still. And we'll build this love from the ground up, for worse or for better. And I will be all you need. Beside you, I'll stand through the good and the bad. We'll give all that we have. And we'll build this love from the ground up. From the ground up.	7
	Head over Feet	Alanis Morissette				I had no choice but to hear you. You stated your case time, and again I thought about it. You treat me like I'm a princess, I'm not used to liking that. You ask how my day was. You've already won me over in spite of me and don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault. Your love is thick, and it swallowed me whole. You're so much braver than I gave you credit for. That's not lip service. You've already won me over in spite of me and don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault. You are the bearer of unconditional things. You held your breath and the door for me. Thanks for your patience. You're the best listener that I've ever met. You're my best friend, best friend with benefits. What took me so long? I've never felt this healthy before. I've never wanted something rational. I am aware now. I am aware now. You've already won me over in spite of me and don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault.	8
	One Man Band	Old Dominion				Been flying solo for so long. Nobody's singing a harmony. Up there just me and my shadow - no bass, no guitar, no tambourine. And I found you like a melody. You were singing in the same key as me. We had 'em dancing in the streets. I don't wanna be a one-man-band. I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone putting miles on a run-down van. Baby, we can take our own show on the road, I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune. We'll get tattoos and we'll trash hotel rooms. Baby, take my hand, I don't wanna be a one-man-band. I wanna run down your wild dreams and I wanna chase every high with you, count every rip in these old jeans. We'll never learn how to sing the blues. If I'm gonna be famous, girl, I wanna be famous with you. We got our own little groove. I don't wanna be a one-man-band. I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone putting miles on a run-down van. Baby, we can take our own show on the road, I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune. We'll get tattoos and we'll trash hotel rooms. Baby, take my hand 'cause I don't wanna be a one-man-band. When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down, the chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around and nobody's paying, we'll still be playing. I don't wanna be a one-man-band. I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone putting miles on a run-down van. Baby, we can take our own show on the road, I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune. We'll get tattoos and we'll trash hotel rooms. Baby, take my hand 'cause I don't wanna be a one-man-band. I don't wanna be a one-man-band.	7
	Dare	Stan Bush				Sometimes when your hopes have all been shattered, and there's nowhere to turn, you wonder how you keep going (going). Think of all the things that really mattered and the chances you've earned. The fire in your heart is growing (growing). You can fly if you try, leaving the past behind, heaven only knows what you might find. Dare, dare to believe you can survive, you hold the future in your hand. Dare, dare to keep all of your dreams alive. It's time to take a stand, and you can win if you dare. Everybody's trying to break your spirit, keeping you down. Seems like it's been forever (ever), oh, but there's another voice if you'll just hear it saying it's the last round. Looks like it's now or never (never). Out of the darkness, you stumble into the light, fighting for the things you know are right. Dare, dare to believe you can survive, the power is there at your command. Dare, dare to keep all of your dreams alive, it's time to take a stand, and you can win if you dare. Dare, dare to believe you can survive, you hold the future in your hand. Dare, dare to keep all of your dreams alive, the power is there at your command, oh. Dare, dare to keep all your love alive, dare to be all you can be. Dare, there is a place where dreams survive, and it's calling you on to victory. Dare, dare.	8
	Brown Eyed Girl	Van Morrison				Hey, where did we go? Days when the rains came down in the hollow. Playin' a new game, laughing and a running hey, hey. Skipping and a jumping in the misty morning fog with our hearts a thumpin' and you, my brown-eyed girl. You, my brown-eyed girl. Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow? Going down the old mine with a transistor radio. Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall. Slipping and sliding all along the waterfall, with you, my brown-eyed girl. You, my brown-eyed girl. Do you remember when we used to sing sha la la la la la la la la la la te da? Just like that, sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da. So hard to find my way now that I'm all on my own. I saw you just the other day. My, how you have grown, cast my memory back there, Lord. Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout making love in the green grass behind the stadium with you, my brown-eyed girl. You, my brown-eyed girl. Do you remember when we used to sing sha la la la la la la la la la la te da? Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da (bit by bit, by bit, by bit, by bit, by bit), sha la la la la la la, la te da, la te da, sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da (La te da, da da da da da da da da).	8

	Something Just Like This	Coldplay ft. Nicole Cross				I've been reading books of old. The legends and a myths, Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts, Spiderman's control, and Batman with his fists, and clearly, I don't see myself upon that list. She said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts, some superhero, some fairytale bliss, just something I can turn to. Somebody I can kiss. I want something just like this" Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm. Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm na. Da-da-da, da-da-da. Oh, I want something just like this. Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm. Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm na. Da-da-da, da-da-da. Oh, I want something just like this. Oh, I want something just like this. I've been reading books of old. The legends and the myths, the testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse, and Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts, but I'm not the kind of person that it fits. She said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts, some superhero, some fairytale bliss, just something I can turn to. Somebody I can miss. I want something just like this" Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm. Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm na. Da-da-da, da-da-da. Oh, I want something just like this. Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm. Doo-doo-doo, mmhmm na.

	Irish Wedding Song	The Irish Rovers				Here they stand, hand in hand. They exchanged wedding bands. Today is the day of all their dreams and their plans. And all of their loved ones are here to say, "God bless this couple who marry today." In good times and bad times, in sickness and health, may they know that riches are not needed for wealth. And help them face problems they'll meet on their way. Oh, God bless this couple who marry today. May they find peace of mind comes to all who are kind. May the rough times ahead become triumphs in time. May their children be happy each day. Oh, God bless the family who started today. As they go, may they know ev'ry love that has shown and as life it gets shorter may their feelings grow. Wherever they travel, wherever they stay, may God bless this couple who marry today.	11
	You're Still the one	The Orleans				We've been together since way back when. Sometimes, I never want to see you again. But I want you to know, after all these years you're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear. You're still the one, I want to talk to in bed. Still the one, that turns my head. We're still having fun, and you're still the one I looked at your face every day. But I never saw it 'til I went away. When winter came, I just wanted to go. (wanted to go) Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow. You're still the one, that makes me laugh. Still the one, that's my better half. We're still having fun, and you're still the one. You're still the one, that makes me strong. Still the one, I want to take along. We're still having fun, and you're still the one. (yes you are) Changing, our love is going gold even though we grow old, it grows new. You're still the one, that I love to touch. Still the one, and I can't get enough. We're still having fun, and you're still the one. You're still the one, who can scratch my itch. Still the one, and I wouldn't switch. We're still having fun, and you're still the one. You are still the one, that makes me shout. Still the one, that I dream about. We're still having fun, and you're still the one. You're still the one, yeah, still the one. We're still having fun, and you're still the one.	8
	Best In Me	Blue				From the moment I met you, I just knew you'd be mine. You touched my hand, and I knew that this was gonna be our time. I don't ever want to lose this feeling. I don't want to spend a moment apart 'cause you bring out the best in me like no one else can do. That's why I'm by your side (and that's why I love you). Every day that I'm here with you, I know that it feels right (So right, so right). And I've just got to be near you every day, and every night (every night). And you know that we belong together. (Ooh) It just had to be you and me (Ooh) 'cause you bring out the best in me like no one else can do. That's why I'm by your side (and that's why I love you). And you know that we belong together. It just had to be you and me 'cause you bring out the best in me like no one else can do. That's why I'm by your side (and that's why I love you). You touched my hand. 'Cause you bring out the best in me like no one else can do. That's why I'm by your side (and that's why I love you)'cause you bring out the best in me like no one else can do. That's why I'm by your side (and that's why I love you).	8.5
	We found each other in the dark	City & Color				I heard the church bells from afar, but we found each other in the dark. And when the smoke does finally pass we will rise above all the ash. Cause we're gonna live, we're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live at last. So bright, the flames burned in our hearts that we found each other in the dark. Black beast, out in the wilderness, we are fighting to survive and convalesce. But we're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live. We're gonna live like the rest. Through the black soulless water and the cold lonely air, on the rock restless seas the vessel in deep disrepair and the swans they started singing. But then oh, rejoice. I can still hear your voice, then I heard the church bells from afar, but we found each other in the dark.	9
	Then you can tell me goodbye	The Casinos				Kiss me each morning for a million years. Hold me each evening by your side. Tell me you'll love me for a million years, then if it don't work out. Then if it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye. Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss. Soften my dreams with your sighs. Tell me you'll love me for a million years, then if it don't work out. Then if it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye. If you must go, oh no, I won't grieve. If you wait a lifetime before you leave, then if you must go, I won't tell you, no. Just so, that we can say we tried. Tell me you'll love me for a million years, then if it don't work out. Then if it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye.	12
	On the run part 2	Jay-Z & Beyonce				Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway? Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché. Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway? Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché. What about the bad guy goes good, yeah? An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah? Black hourglass, hourglass. Toast to cliché is in a dark past. Toast to cliché is in a dark past. Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman. Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running. Chuck the deuces, chugging D'USSÉ, ugh. Fuck what you say, boys in blue say. I don't care if we on the run. Baby, as long I'm next to you(ooh). And if loving you is a crime. Tell me, why do I bring out the best in you, why? I hear sirens while we make love. Loud as hell, but they don't know they're nowhere near us. I will hold your heart and your gun. I don't care if they come, no. I know it's crazy, but they can take me. Now that I found the places that you take me. Without you, I got nothing to lose. I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick. Bumping 2Pac on my outlaw shit. Matching tats, this ink don't come off, even if rings come off if things ring off. My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty. My lady is my Mercedes is my baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas. Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas. You ain't about that life, ain't gotta lie to me, nigga. You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas, ugh. Cross the line, speak about mine.

Without you, I got nothing to lose. Deeper than words, beyond right. Die for your love, beyond life. Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice. Blind me, baby, with your neon lights. Ray-Ban's on police insight. Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white. If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell, just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's. She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy. What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys? They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it. If it's me and you against the world, then so be it. I don't care if they give me life. I get all of my life from you (ooh). And if loving you had a price, I would pay my life for you. I hear sirens while we make love. Loud as hell, but they don't know they're nowhere near us. I will hold your heart and your gun. I don't care if they come, no. I know it's crazy, but I don't care I'll never give it up. Give it up, give it up, give it all away. No, I swear I'll never give it up. Give it up, give it up, give it all away. I don't care. I'll never give it up. Give it up, give it up, give it all away. No, I swear I'll never give it up. Give it up, give it up, give it all away. (Without you I got nothing to lose).	5
	If it wasn’t for your love	Heather Headley				Would I be standing here after all these years, among the stars above? Maybe not, if it wasn't for your love. Smiling faces, all around like when the king has just been crowned. A battle has been won that I'd have lost if it wasn't for your love. A fairy tale unfolds, more true than stories I've been told. At last, my chance to shine and all in perfect time. A life I'd once dreamed of, who'd have thought? If it wasn't for your love. And oh, the wonderful surprise to have a light so bright it blinds. It blinds my eyes, but finally, I see. How it feels to live a dream, but would I have touched the sky? Ever flown so high? Ooh, not I, if it wasn't for your love.	12
	All The Way	Jacob Bryant				Pretty day, pretty girl, truck cleaned up. Gonna take her 'round the world, bout the only thing that gets to me these days is her smilin' face. She don't even know what she does to me, knowin' she don't even know how she makes me believe that it's gonna be okay when life gets crazy. 'Cause she's that ring in the window I'm gonna buy someday. She's the warmth in my soul, every breath I take. I've got her heart in my hands, and I'm gonna be the man, the one who stays. 'Cause she makes me wanna go all the way. I bet her daddy, and her mama can already see where this thing is goin' and how much she means to me. And I'm gonna be that one that takes her hand.

She's the warmth in my soul, every breath I take. I've got her heart in my hands, and I'm gonna be the man, the one who stays. 'Cause she makes me wanna go, yeah, she makes me wanna go all the way.	8
	Joy to the World	Three Dog Night				Jeremiah was a bullfrog, was a good friend of mine. I never understood a single word he said, but I helped him a-drink his wine. And he always had some mighty fine wine. Singin' joy to the world, all the boys and girls now. Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me.  And if I were the king of the world, tell you what I'd do. I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war, make sweet love to you. Sing it now, joy to the world, all the boys and girls. Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me. You know I love the ladies, love to have my fun. I'm a high life flyer and a rainbow rider.

	Now and Forever	Air Supply				When love is new, and the world is out reaching for you. We try hard to hold it all in our hands, but it slips through like soft drifting sands. But drying the tears can build it all like new. Now and forever, remember the words from my heart will always be true. Now and forever together and all that I feel, here's my love for you. Learning each day that the right time was so far away to tell you the things I knew. Now, it's clear that the moment we searched for is here. And counting the years is all I want to do. Now and forever, remember the words from my heart will always be true. Now and forever, together and all that I feel, here's my love for you. Hold me as close as love will allow until all your fears are gone. What has all passed is over now. I'm here with you. I'm here with you. I'm holding on. I'm holding on.

	A Kiss to Build a Dream On	Louis Armstrong				Give me a kiss to build a dream on. And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss. Sweetheart, I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on. Give me a kiss before you leave me. And my imagination will feed my hungry heart. Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on. When I’m alone with my fancies, I’ll be with you. Weaving romances, making believe they’re true. Give me your lips for just a moment. And my imagination will make that moment live. Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on. When I’m alone with my fancies, I’ll be with you. Weaving romances, making believe they’re true. Oh, give me your lips for just a moment. And my imagination will make that moment live. Oh, give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on.	11
	Now and Forever	Richard Marx				Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head. You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread. I lose my way, but still you seem to understand. Now and forever, I will be your man. Sometimes I just hold you, too caught up in me to see I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me. I'll try to show you each and every way I can. Now and forever, I will be your man. Now I can rest my worries and always be sure that I won't be alone anymore. If I'd only known you were there all the time. All this time until the day, the ocean doesn't touch the sand. Now and forever, I will be your man. Now and forever, I will be your man.	12
	Not Enough	Van Halen				To love somebody naturally, to love somebody faithfully. To love somebody equally is not enough, is not enough, is not enough. To love somebody secretly and never touch. To love somebody honestly and always trust, to love somebody tenderly. The tender touch is not enough. Is not enough. Love hurts, sometimes it's not so easy to find, no. Searchin' everywhere you turn and swear it's always been there. To love somebody foolishly can happen once, to love somebody hopelessly, it hurts so much. To love somebody equally is not enough, is not enough, is not enough. Love takes, a little time it's not so easy to find, no. Searchin' everywhere you turn and swear, she's always been there, standin' there, oh. And if it don't come easily, one thing you must believe. You can always have trust in me because my heart will always be yours, honestly. Love hurts, sometimes it's not so easy to find, no. Searchin' everywhere then turn and swear it's always been there, standin' there. Love hurts, sometimes not yours, it's not mine, no. Love's only to share turn and swear it's everywhere, standin' there. 'Cause it's always been there.	8.5
	 A Case of You	Joni Mitchell				Just before our love got lost you said, "I am, as constant as a northern star" and I said, "Constantly in the darkness where's that at? If you want me, I'll be in the bar." On the back of a cartoon coaster in the blue TV screen light, I drew a map of Canada. Oh, Canada with your face sketched on it twice. Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine. You taste so bitter and so sweet. Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling. And I would still be on my feet. Oh, I would still be on my feet. Oh, I am a lonely painter. I live in a box of paints. I'm frightened by the devil, and I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid. I remember that time you told me, you said, "Love is touching souls," surely, you touched mine. 'Cause part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time. Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine, you taste so bitter and so sweet. Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling. And still, I'd be on my feet, I would still be on my feet. I met a woman she had a mouth like yours. She knew your life, she knew, your devils and your deeds. And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can, but be prepared to bleed." Oh, but you are in my blood. You're my holy wine. You're so bitter, bitter, and so sweet. Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling. Still, I'd be on my feet, I would still be on my feet.	8

Do you thirst for a drink from the well? Jesus is calling. O come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide. Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

	Tonight, I celebrate my Love	Roberta Flack & Peabo Bryson				Tonight I celebrate my love for you. It seems like the natural thing to do. Tonight no one's gonna find us. We'll leave the world behind us when I make love to you. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. And I hope that deep inside you feel it too. Tonight our spirits will be climbing to a sky lit with diamonds. When I make love to you, tonight. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through.

Tonight there'll be no distance between us. What I want most to do is to make love to you. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. Tonight I celebrate my love for you.	10
	If I Fall	Doc Walker				I've been waiting for the perfect moment. My hands are shaking, but my heart is true. I've been waiting to say, I love you, but I want to be sure you'll say, you love me too. So baby, won't you say it with me? Or leave me out in the cold. If I fall right here, would you carry me home? And if you feel the way I feel, then you've got to let me know. If I fall right here, would you carry me home? Pulled off the highway, let the motor idle. Girl, there's a reason why I brought you here, I said, I love you and sat there silent that one moment felt like a thousand years. So baby, will you stay with me? Or leave me out here in the cold. If I fall right here, would you carry me home? And if you feel the way I feel, then you've got to let me know. If I fall right here, would you carry me home? I've been waiting for the perfect moment. My hands are shaking, but my heart is true.	10
	For the Dancing and Dreaming	John Powell				I'll swim and sail on savage seas with never a fear of drowning, and gladly ride the waves of life. If you would marry me, no scorching sun nor freezing cold will stop me (on my journey, sorry!), if you will promise me your heart and love. And love me for eternity. My dearest one, my darling dear, your mighty words astound me. But I've no need for mighty deeds when I feel your arms around me. But I would bring you rings of gold. I'd even sing you poetry (oh, would you?). And I would keep you from all harm if you would stay beside me. I have no use for rings of gold. I care not for your poetry. I only want your hand to hold. I only want you near me. To love and kiss to sweetly hold for the dancing and the dreaming through all life's sorrows and delights. I'll keep your laugh inside me. I'll swim and sail a savage seas with never a fear of drowning. I'd gladly ride the waves so white. And you will marry me? (Eee I'm still going, I'm done!)	9
	September Doves	The Lost Dog Street Band				There was a very sacred place back where I grew between three old pine trees that nobody knew. I'd close my eyes and pass the time like youngin's often do, but now I'm long gone, completely ruined. Darlin', you and I were made for many different things, to live and learn, and lie and laugh, fight and dance and sing. But our hearts have been so battered by the things that we have seen, and I can feel it in the way you look at me. We could pick any old road and start again. Hell, we could change our names and try to forget. Lord, knows I'll be sorry when it's done, but circumstances shot us down like September doves. Circumstances shot us down like September doves. My grandmother's lullabies used to sing me to sleep. I can't sleep nowadays without liquid relief. Well, if lullabies were whiskey, then my Grandma's drinks were cheap. I can't afford sleep anymore. And we were never made for love our souls are far too old. But loneliness needs company and a lost dog needs a home. So you will be the fire, and I will be the coal. Baby, we can burn out of control. We could pick any old road and start again. Hell, we could change our names and try to forget. Lord, knows I'll be sorry when it's done. But circumstances shot us down like September doves. Circumstances shot us down like September doves. We could pick any old road and start again. Hell, we could change our names and try to forget. Lord, knows I'll be sorry when it's done. But circumstances shot us down like September doves. Circumstances shot us down like September doves.	7
	The Bones	Maren Morris				We're in the homestretch of the hard times we took a hard left, but we're alright. Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but we built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it. When the bones are good, the rest don't matter. Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter let it rain 'cause you, and I remain the same. When there ain't a crack in the foundation. Baby, I know any storm we're facing will blow right over while we stay put. The house don't fall when the bones are good. Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I can't even mess it up, although we both try. No, it don't always go the way we planned it. But the wolves came and went, and we're still standing. When the bones are good, the rest don't matter. Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same. When there ain't a crack in the foundation. Baby, I know any storm we're facing will blow right over while we stay put. The house don't fall when the bones are good. When the bones are good, bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (baby, it don't really matter). Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter). Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (ooh). Paint could peel. The glass, the glass could shatter (yeah). When the bones are good, the rest don't matter. Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter tet it rain (let it rain, let it rain). 'Cause you and I remain the same (woo). When there ain't a crack in the foundation (woo). Baby, I know any storm we're facing will blow right over while we stay put. The house don't fall when the bones are good, yeah, ooh.	7
	I Love You Always Forever	Donna Lewis				Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream of light mists of pale amber rose. Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent touching, discovering you. Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me. Miles of windless summer night air. Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon. Out of the stillness soft-spoken words, say it, say it again, I love you always forever, near and far closer together.

	Fall Into Me	Brantley Gilbert				A whisper away from changin' everything but is it safe to say such dangerous things. When your hands are tremblin', girl I'm weak in the knees. It's times like these when silence means everything, more than anything. So fall when you're ready baby. Let our kiss count the moments and hearts set the pace. I'll be your love song and I'll love you right off your feet until you fall into me. Love ain't a race, there's no finish line and I love a chase but don't leave me behind 'cause girl we're both gamblin' but I'm playin' for keeps. It's time like these when patience means everything, more than anything. So fall when you're ready baby. Let our kiss count the moments and hearts set the pace. I'll be your love song and I'll love you right off your feet. And I'll fall for you every day, I'll cherish the moments time can't erase. We'll be the love song I promise you we're gonna sing. Girl when you fall into me, girl when you fall into me. C'mon baby fall into me, I'm waiting, fall into me, fall into me, fall into me. A whisper away from changing everything.

	The Very Thought of You	Michael Buble				The very thought of you and I forget to do the little ordinary things that everyone ought to do. I'm living in a kind of daydream. I'm happy as a king and foolish though it may seem. To me, that's everything. The mere idea of you, the longing here for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go. 'Til I'm near to you, I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above. It's the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love. I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you, my love.	13
	Gold All Over The Ground	Brad Paisley				If I had you at my mercy, there's no telling what I'd do. But I'd sit and make you listen, for an hour, maybe two. And then you'd know I need you every day that rolls around, and your feet would walk on velvet with gold all over the ground. Your trails would be downhill. A soft breeze at your back, a sky full of diamonds, and your nights would not be black. Yes, you would really love it and if you're ever down. I'd give you rows of roses and gold all over the ground. I'd pick you up and carry you 'cross every stream I see, and I'd bundle you in kindness until you cling to me. We'd sit beneath strong branches. My arms would twine around. I'd turn your green to emerald, and give you gold all over the ground. I'd pick you up and carry you 'cross every stream I see, and I'd bundle you in kindness until you cling to me.

	Lost In Love	Air Supply				I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice, and it don't count for much, but I'm not letting go. I believe there's still much to believe in. So lift your eyes if you feel you can. Reach for a star, and I'll show you a plan. I figured it out what I needed was someone to show me. You know you can't fool me. I've been loving you too long. It started so easy. You want to carry on. Lost in love and I don't know much. Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted.

	I and Love and You	The Avett Brothers				Load the car and write the note, grab your bag and grab your coat. Tell the ones that need to know we are headed north. One foot in and one foot back, but it don't pay to live like that. So I cut the ties, and I jumped the tracks for never to return. Ahm, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in. Are you aware the shape I'm in? My hands they shake, my head it spins. Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in. When at first, I learned to speak, I used all my words to fight with him and her and you and me. Oh, but it's just a waste of time. Yeah, it's such a waste of time. That woman she's got eyes that shine like a pair of stolen polished dimes. She asked to dance I said, "It's fine, I'll see you in the morning time." Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in. Are you aware the shape I'm in? My hands they shake, my head it spins. Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in. Three words that became hard to say, I and love and you. What you were then, I am today. Look at the things I do. Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in. Are you aware the shape I'm in? My hands they shake, my head it spins. Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in. Dumbed down and numbed by time and age. Your dreams to catch the world, the cage, the highway sets the traveler's stage all exits look the same. Three words that became hard to say, I and love and you. I and love and you. I and love and you.	8
	Nobody But You	Blake Shelton				Don't have to leave this town to see the world 'cause there's something that I gotta do. I don't wanna look back in thirty years and wonder who you're married to. Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear, for only you and God to hear. When you love someone, they say you set 'em free, but that ain't gonna work for me. I don't wanna live without you. I don't wanna even breathe. I don't wanna dream about you, wanna wake up with you next to me. I don't wanna go down any other road now. I don't wanna love nobody but you. Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now, I don't wanna love nobody but you, you. All the wasted days, all the wasted nights, I blame it all on being young. Got no regrets 'cause they got me here, but I don't wanna waste another one. I been thinkin' about what I want in my life. It begins and ends the same. If I had to choose what I couldn't lose, there'd only be one thing. I don't wanna live without you. I don't wanna even breathe. I don't wanna dream about you, wanna wake up with you next to me. I don't wanna go down any other road now. I don't wanna love nobody but you. Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now, I don't wanna love nobody but you, you (I don't wanna love nobody but you), you. I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear, for only you and God to hear. I don't wanna live without you (I don't wanna live). I don't wanna even breathe. I don't wanna dream about you wanna wake up with you next to me (next to me). I don't wanna go down any other road now. I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody). Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now. I don't wanna love nobody but you, you (I don't wanna love nobody), you (I don't wanna love nobody but you).	7
	Lightning Crashes	Live Band				Lightning crashes, a new mother cries, her placenta falls to the floor. The angel opens her eyes. The confusion sets in before the doctor can even close the door. Lightning crashes, an old mother dies, her intentions fall to the floor. The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers belongs now, to the baby down the hall. Oh, now I feel it comin' back again like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind. Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again, I can feel it. Lightning crashes, a new mother cries, this moment she's been waiting for. The angel opens her eyes, pale blue colored eyes. Presents the circle and puts the glory out to hide, hide. Oh, now I feel it comin' back again like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind. Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again, I can feel it. I can feel it. Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why. Oh, now I feel it comin' back again like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind. Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again, I can feel it. I can feel it comin' back again like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind. Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again, I can feel it. I can feel it comin' back again like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind. Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again, I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it.	8
	Work Song	Hozier				Boys workin' on empty. Is that the kind'a way to face the burning heat? I just think about my baby. I'm so full of love I could barely eat. There's nothing sweeter than my baby. I'd never want once from the cherry tree 'cause my baby's sweet as can be. She give me toothaches just from kissin' me. When my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth. No grave can hold my body down. I'll crawl home to her. Boys, when my baby found me, I was three days on a drunken sin. I woke with her walls around me. Nothin' in her room but an empty crib and I was burnin' up a fever. I didn't care much how long I lived, but I swear I thought I dreamed her. She never asked me once about the wrong I did. When my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth. No grave can hold my body down. I'll crawl home to her. When my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth. No grave can hold my body down. I'll crawl home to her. My baby, never fret none about what my hands and my body done. If the Lord don't forgive me, I'd still have my baby, and my babe would have me. When I was kissing on my baby, and she put her love down soft and sweet. In the lowland plot, I was free. Heaven and hell were words to me. When my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth. No grave can hold my body down. I'll crawl home to her. When my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth. No grave can hold my body down. I'll crawl home to her.	7
	Dreams	The Cranberries				Oh, my life is changing every day in every possible way. And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems, never quite as it seems. I know I've felt like this before, but now I'm feeling it even more because it came from you. Then I open up and see the person falling here is me, a different way to be. I want more, impossible to ignore, impossible to ignore. They'll come true, impossible not to do, impossible not to do. Now I tell you openly. You have my heart, so don't hurt me. You're what I couldn't find totally amazing mind. So understanding and so kind, you're everything to me. Oh, my life is changing every day in every possible way. And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems. 'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me.	11
	All I Need	Jack Wagner				Kissing you is not what I had planned, and now I'm not so sure just where I stand. I wasn't looking for true love, but now you're looking at me. You're the only one I can think of. You're the only one I see, all I need. Is just a little more time to be sure what I feel. Is it all in my mind? Cause it seems so hard to believe that you're all I need. Yes, it's true we've all been hurt before, but it doesn't seem to matter anymore. It may be a chance we're taking, but it always comes to this. If this isn't love we're making, then I don't know what it is. All I need is just a little more time to be sure what I feel. Is it all in my mind? Cause it seems so hard to believe, all I need is just a little more time to be sure what I feel. Is it all in my mind? Cause it seems so hard to believe that you're all I need. No stars are out tonight, but we're shining our own light, and it's never felt so bright. Cause girl, the way I'm feeling, it's easy to believe that you're all I need. Ah, you're all I need. Oh, ah.	8.5
	True Believers	Darius Rucker				Church bells ringing on our wedding day climbed in that limo and rode away. Guess you'll always hear some people say, "they're never gonna make it." We settled in, and we settled down in this quiet little seaside town. You were the rock I built my world around, and life won't ever break it. We are one heartbeat in the darkness. We are one lasting answered prayer. We are one unbroken promise. We are two, True Believers. It wasn't easy getting here today, sometimes you stumbled, or I lost my way. But every roadblock was a chance to say, "take my hand I'm here beside you." We worked and made it through the toughest parts. Now every day, another chance to start to look around and see that where we are is where we were trying to get to. We are one heartbeat in the darkness. We are one lasting answered prayer. We are one unbroken promise. We are two, True Believers. We are one before our God in Heaven. We are one road when the going gets rough. We are one now and forever. We are one name, one life, one flame. We are one heartbeat in the darkness. We are one lasting answered prayer. We are one unbroken promise, and we are two, True Believers. We are two, True Believers.	8
	Breathe	Bon Jovi				What's the world coming to? Where are we all running to? Not all our dreams are coming true. We can't let it break us in two hearts that beat as one. Can't let the clouds cover the sun, if I'm ramblin', I'm guilty of wearing my heart on my sleeve. When it hurts, breathe. When it burns, breathe. The feeling inside you is feeling like I do. Take a breath, breathe, let it out, breathe. Just close your eyes, don't hold it inside you, breathe. She said, "Baby, you look down tonight. There's something wrong, and that ain't right. I hear you talking in your sleep. I want to dive in your dreams and wrap my loving arms around you. Protect you when the waves crash down on you. When you're lost, and you're scared, I'll be the air. When it hurts, breathe. When it burns, breathe. The feeling inside you is feeling like I do. Take a breath, breathe, let it out, breathe. Just close your eyes, don't hold it inside you, breathe." When you give, and you take, and it feels like something breaks. It's alright, breathe. When it hurts, breathe. When you doubt, breathe. When it burns, breathe, let it out, breathe. When you give, breathe. When you love, breathe. When you live, breathe. When you touch, breathe. If all that we've got is each other, then all that we got is a lot. When it hurts, breathe. When it burns, breathe. The feeling inside you is feeling like I do. Take a breathe, breathe, let it out, breathe. Just close your eyes, don't hold it inside you.	7.5
	Outlaw In Me	Brantley Gilbert				She says, "Baby, what's that scar from?" I said, "Girl, you don't wanna know." She said, "What about this one or that one?" "Girl, that was a long time ago." She kisses and traces every one with her hands. The look on her face says she understands. My baby, don't try to change me 'cause she knows, this is the way that God made me. She gets every flaw, my rebel heart, every tattoo, every scar. She's in love with the outlaw in me. She knows I roll with a rough crowd, and we get wild time to time. She knows I won't lay my guns down. I never run from a fight. My baby, don't try to change me. She knows, this is the way that God made me. She gets every flaw, my rebel heart, every tattoo, every scar. She's in love with the outlaw in me. Yeah, alright, that girl knows that she's got me. And prays one day I'll settle down. And I just thank God she loves me even when I don't know how. My baby, don't try to change me. She knows this is the way that God made me. She gets every flaw, my rebel heart, every tattoo, every scar. She's in love with the outlaw in me. She's in love with the outlaw, in me.	8.5
	God Gave Me You	Bryan White				For all the times I felt cheated, I complained. You know how I love to complain. For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame, I still cursed that rain. I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue. Then out of the blue, God gave me you to show me what's real. There's more to life with just how I feel, and all that I'm worth is right before my eyes and all that I live for though I didn't know why. Now I do, 'cause God gave me you. For all the times I wore my self-pity like a favorite shirt all wrapped up in that hurt. For every glass I saw, I saw half empty. Now it overflows like a river through my soul. From every doubt I had, I'm finally free. And I truly believe, God gave me you to show me what's real. There's more to life than just how I feel, and all that I'm worth is right before my eyes and all that I live for though I didn't know why. Now I do, 'cause God gave me you. In your arms, I'm someone new with ever tender kiss from you. Oh, must confess, I've been blessed. God gave me you to show me what's real. There's more to life than just how I feel, and all that I'm worth is right before my eyes and all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why). Now I do (I finally do), 'cause God gave me you (God gave me You). God gave me you.	8
	The Day Before You	Rascal Flatts				I had all, but given up on finding the one that I could fall into. On the day before you, I was ready to settle for less than love and not much more. There was no such thing as a dream come true. Oh, but that was all the day before you. Now you're here, and everything's changing, suddenly life means so much. I can't wait to wake up tomorrow and find out this promise is true. I will never have to go back to the day before you. In your eyes, I see forever. Makes me wish that my life never knew the day before you. Oh, but Heaven knows those years without you were shaping my heart for the that day I found you. If you're the reason for all that I've been through, then I'm thankful for the day before you. Now you're here, and everything's changing, suddenly life means so much. I can't wait to wake up tomorrow and find out this promise is true. I will never have to go back to the day before you. Was the last day that I ever lived alone. And I'm never going back. No, I'm never going back. Now you're here, and everything's changing, suddenly life means so much. I can't wait to wake up tomorrow and find out this promise is true. No, I'm never going back, I will never have to go back to the day before you.	8
	Wonderful Tonight	Eric Clapton				It's late in the evening she's wondering what clothes to wear. She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair. And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight." We go to a party, and everyone turns to see. This beautiful lady, that's walking around with me. And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?" And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight" I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes. And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize how much I love you. It's time to go home now, and I've got an aching head. So I give her the car keys, and she helps me to bed. And then I tell her as I turn out the light I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight. Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."	11
	Say It Again	Don Williams				Oh, all I needed was one look, one magic moment was all it took. From that moment, I loved you so. Now that I found you, I'm never gonna let you go. Come on, say it, say it again. It sounds so good say it. One more time and then. Well if you mean it say it again, the hard part's over, and the loving part begins. Oh, hold me closer, make me warm. I feel wanted here in your arms. I've been lonely for too long, I've waited a lifetime for you to come along. So on, say it, say it again. It sounds so good say it. One more time and then. Well if you mean it, say it again. The hard part's over and the loving part begins. Come on, say it, say it again. It sounds so good say it. One more time and then. Well if you mean it, say it again. The hard part's over and the loving part begins.	11
	You Do Something To Me	Paul Weller				You do something to me, something deep inside. I'm hanging on the wire for a love I'll never find. You do something wonderful, then chase it all away. Mixing my emotions that throws me back again. Hanging on the wire, yeah. I'm waiting for the change. I'm dancing through the fire just to catch a flame an' feel real again. Hanging on the wire, yeah. Said, I'm waiting for the change. Oh, I'm dancing through the fire just to catch a flame an' feel real again. You do something to me, somewhere deep inside. I'm hoping to get close to a peace I cannot find. Dancing through the fire, yeah. Just to catch a flame. Just to get close to. Just close enough to tell you that. You do something to me, something deep inside.	11
	But I'll Never Forget The Way You Make Me Feel	Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors				I might forget what you wore on the 14th day of May. I might forget the songs they sang that night on the stage. I might forget what you ordered at the Sunset Grill, but I'll never forget the way you make me feel. I'll never forget the way you make me feel. I might forget night-swimming at your apartment after midnight. I might forget our trip to Charleston, walking barefoot in the moonlight. I might forget holding you close in the late December chill, but I'll never forget the way you make me feel. I'll never forget the way you make me feel. Singing next to me at the Hi Tone Cafe. Hoping for a companion to go make some mistakes. We're dancing at Annie's wedding, two starry-eyed kids. Hoping maybe someday we will grow old like this. We watched the sun go down over the Great Smokey Mountains. We talked about the future, my heart was pounding. I push fast forward, I'm your husband, you're my wife. It's harder, but better, it's not a song, it's my life. When I'm an old man, and can't recognize my own face and the memories of our youth are hard for me to trace. When death comes to take me, my body to steal. I'll never forget the way you made me feel. I'll never forget the way you made me feel.	8
	Better Together	Luke Combs				A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat. Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts, 8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields. One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel. Some things just go better together and probably always will. Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill. What's the point of this old guitar, if it ain't got no strings? Or pouring your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing? It's a match made up in heaven like good ole boys and beer. And me, as long as you're right here. Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown. Your lipstick stained every coffee cup that I got in this house. The way you say, I love you too, is like rain on an old tin roof. And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove. Some things just go better together and probably always will. Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill. What's the point of this old guitar, if it ain't got no strings? Or pouring your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing? It's a match made up in heaven like good ole boys and beer. And me, as long as you're right here. Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way. And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name would just sound better together and probably always will. Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill. What's the point of this old guitar, if it ain't got no strings? Or pouring your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing? It's a match made up in heaven like good ole boys and beer and me, as long as you're right here. And me, as long as you're right here.	7
	Crash Into Me	Dave Matthew's Band				You've got your ball. You've got your chain. Tied to me tight, tie me up again. Who's got their claws in you my friend. Into your heart, I'll beat again. Sweet like candy to my soul, sweet you rock and sweet you roll. Lost for you, I'm so lost for you. You come crash into me, and I come into you. I come into you. In a boys dream. In a boys dream. Touch your lips just so I know. In your eyes, love, it glows so. I'm bare-boned and crazy for you. When you come crash into me, baby and I come into you. In a boys dream, in a boys dream. If I've gone overboard then I'm begging you to forgive me. In my haste, when I'm holding you so girl close to me. Oh and you come crash into me, baby, and I come into you. Hike up your skirt a little more and show the world to me. Hike up your skirt a little more and show your world to me. In a boy's dream, in a boy's dream. Oh I watch you there through the window and I stare at you. You wear nothing but you. Wear it so well. Tied up and twisted, the way I'd like to be. For you, for me, come crash into me. Baby oh Crash into me. Crash into me. Crash into me. Crash into me. I'm the king of the castle. Your a dirty rascle, crash into me!	8.5
	Song #3	Stone Sour				If you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away. So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe. No one else has ever loved me. No one else has ever tried. I never understood how much I could take. Then I saw the worst was over when I laid my eyes on you. It was all that I could do to know my place. Out of all the vast illusions. Out of all the dreams come true. I was gone until I finally saw your face. If you cried out for more, if you reached out for me. I would run into the storm just to keep you here with me. I have gone beyond my years, I've wasted half my life, but I found it all in you. Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too. Let me take a step towards you. Let me feel you in my hands. Let me cross this line and show you where it leads. There's a darkness down inside me that I know we'll both enjoy, and it's screaming from within to set it free. I have left this bloody nightmare in my wake, but out of sight, all I want is deviation by design. Out of all the past confusion. Out of all the common spite. Just tell me I am yours, 'cause you are mine. And if you cried out for more, if you reached out for me. I would run into the storm just to keep you here with me. I have gone beyond my years, I've wasted half my life, but I found it all in you. Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too. It doesn't really matter what you do or say. I'm never going anywhere anyway 'cause when I'm dying for you, I've never felt so alive. If you cried out for more, if you reached out for me. I would run into the storm just to keep you here with me. I have gone beyond my years, I've wasted half my life, but I found it all in you. Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me too. I know you saved me too.	7

	Something Just Like This	Chainsmokers				I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths. Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts, Spiderman's control and Batman with his fists and clearly I don't see myself upon that list. But she said, "Where'd you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts. Some superhero, some fairytale bliss. Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss.

I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts. Some superhero, some fairytale bliss. Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss. I want something just like this.

	On And On We Walk Together	R.J. Stevens Music				My Savior daily walks with me because I trust His love in all that’s best. His hand I see, it points to heavn’ above. I will follow Him thru shadows dim or in the sunshine bright, and on we walk together, leads my steps aright. My Savior holds my hand each day and tells me not to fear. When tempted, to Him I must pray. For He is always near. On the gospel road, He’ll share my load, sin can’t my soul affright, and He, on we walk together, Christ is by my side, fear no stormy weather. For He is a faithful guide, you can’t find another. Waves obey His will, speaks to you, my brother come and hear His “Peace be still”. Upon my blessed Lord I lean, my all to Him confide. No more the shadows come between, I’m walking by His side. In true faith will I on Him rely, He makes my burdens light.	11

	Make You Feel My Love	Adele				When the rain is blowing in your face, and the whole world is on your case. I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love. When the evening shadows and the stars appear, and there is no one there to dry your tears. I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love. I know you haven't made your mind up yet, but I will never do you wrong. I've known it from the moment that we met. No doubt in my mind where you belong. I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue. I'd go crawling down the avenue. No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love. The storms are raging on the rolling sea and on the highway of regret. The winds of change are blowing wild and free. You ain't seen nothing like me yet. I could make you happy, make your dreams come true. Nothing that I wouldn't do. Go to the ends of the Earth for you. To make you feel my love. To make you feel my love.	10

Or will he stay anyway, anyway? Oh Lord, what did I do to deserve her? Heaven knows, Lord knows, I'm only human. Can this be someone truly for me, or is it a cruel fantasy?

In my life, I know that you treasure me.	14

	Dance Macabre	Ghost				You'll soon be hearing the chime close to midnight. If I could turn back the time, I'd make all right. How can it end like this? There's a sting in the way you kiss me.

	Made To Love Her	Stevie Wonder				I was born in Lil' Rock. Had a childhood sweetheart, we were always hand in hand. I was hightop shoes and shirt tails. Suzy was in pigtails.

	Carried Away	George Strait				I don't take my whiskey to extremes. Don't believe in chasin' crazy dreams. My feet are planted firmly on the ground, but darlin' when you come around, I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes before I even realize the ride I'm on. Baby, I'm long gone, I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you. Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away.

	Why Don't You and I	Santana				Since the moment I spotted you, like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes. My stomach's filled with the butterflies (ooh), and it's alright. Bouncin' round from cloud to cloud, I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down if I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied. Every time I try to talk to you, I get tongue-tied. Turns out that everything I say to you comes out wrong and never comes out right. So I'll say, why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever. Heads we will and tails we'll try again. So I say, why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven 'cause without you they're never going to let me in.

I bet the whole wide world just wishes they were us, and though sometimes it ain't perfect. Baby, I know it's all worth it 'cause you make it easy to stay in love. We'll stick together.

I bet the whole wide world just wishes they were us and though sometimes it ain't perfect, baby, I know it's all worth it 'cause you make it easy, to stay in love.

	Without You	Motley Crue				Without you, there's no change. My nights and days are gray if I reached out, and touched the rain, it wouldn't feel the same. Without you, I'd be lost. I'd slip down from the top. I'd slide down so low. Girl, you'd never, never know. Without you, without you, a sailor lost at sea. Without you, woman, the world comes down on me. Without you in my life, I'd slowly wilt and die. But with you by my side, you're the reason I'm alive. But with you in my life, you're the reason I'm alive. But without you, without you. Without you, there's no change. My nights and days are gray if I reached out, and touched the rain, it wouldn't feel the same. Without you, without you, I'm a sailor lost at sea.

But with you by my side, you're the reason I'm alive.	8
	I'm A Believer	Monkeys				I thought love was only true in fairy tales. Meant for someone else, but not for me, love was out to get me, that's the way it seemed. Disappointment haunted all of my dreams. Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer. Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love, I'm a believer. I couldn't leave her if I tried. I thought love was more or less a giving thing. Seems the more I gave, the less I got. What's the use in tryin'? All you get is pain? When I needed sunshine, I got rain. Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer. Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love, I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried. Oh, oh, love was out to get me. Now, that's the way it seemed. Disappointment haunted all of my dreams. Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer. Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love, I'm a believer. I couldn't leave her if I tried. Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer. Not a trace of doubt in my mind. Said, I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm a believer). Said, I'm a believer, yeah (I'm a believer). I said, I'm a believer, yeah (I'm a believer).	8
	I Think I Love You	The Partridge Family				I was sleeping, and right in the middle of a good dreamlike all at once. I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain. Before I go insane, I hold my pillow to my head and spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread. I think I love you (I think I love you). This morning, I woke up with this feeling. I didn't know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself. I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it and did not go and shout it when you walked into the room. I think I love you (I think I love you). I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for. I think I love you, isn't that what life is made of? Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way. I don't know what I'm up against. I don't know what it's all about. I got so much to think about. Hey, I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for. I think I love you, isn't that what life is made of? Though it worries me to say I never felt this way. Believe me, you really don't have to worry. I only wanna make you happy, and if you say "hey go away". I will, but I think better still I'd better stay around and love you. Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face? Do you think you love me? I think I love you, I think I love you. I think I love you, I think I love you. I think I love you, I think I love you. I think I love you, I think I love you.	7
	Give Me Forever	James Ingram				Looking out I see, and I know just how much you're a part of me. I see you and I, together in life. So there's nothing I wouldn't do, to make you my wife.

	Leather and Lace	Stevie Nicks & Don Henley				Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow. Shatter with words, impossible to follow. You're saying I'm fragile I try not to be. I search only for something I can't see. I have my own life, and I am stronger than you know. But I carry this feeling when you walked into my house, that you won't be walking out the door. Still, I carry this feeling when you walked into my house, that you won't be walking out the door. Lovers forever face to face. My city, your mountains. Stay with me stay. I need you to love me, I need you today. Give to me your leather, take from me my lace. You, in the moonlight with your sleepy eyes. Could you ever love a man like me and you were right? When I walked into your house, I knew I'd never want to leave. Sometimes I'm a strong man, sometimes cold and scared and sometimes I cry, but that time I saw you, I knew with you to light my nights. Somehow I'd get by. Lovers forever face to face. My city, your mountains. Stay with me stay. I need you to love me, I need you today. Give to me your leather, take from me my lace. Lovers forever face to face. My city, your mountains. Stay with me stay. I need you to love me, I need you today. Give to me your leather, take from me my lace. But take from me my lace. Take from me my lace.	8
	Beauty and the Beast	Angela Lansbury				Tale as old as time, true as it can be. Barely even friends, then somebody bends unexpectedly. Just a little change, small to say the least. Both a little scared, neither one prepared, beauty and the beast. Ever just the same. Ever a surprise. Ever as before, and ever just as sure as the sun will rise. Ever just the same. Ever a surprise. Ever as before. Ever just as sure as the sun will rise. Tale as old as time, tune as old as song. Bittersweet and strange. Finding you can change, learning you were wrong. Certain as the sun rising in the east. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme. Beauty and the Beast. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme. Beauty and the Beast. Beauty and the Beast.	11
	Let's Stay Together	Al Green				Let's stay together. I, I'm I'm so in love with you. Whatever you want to do, is all right with me 'cause you make me feel so brand new, and I want to spend my life with you. Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together. Loving you forever is what I need. Let me be the one you come running to, I'll never be untrue. Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together (together). Lovin' you whether, whether, times are good or bad, happy or sad. Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, whether times are good or bad, happy or sad. Why, why some people break up then turn around and make up.

	As Long As Our Hearts Are Beating	Jenny & Tyler				My bride, my bride, I can hardly hold myself together. This day, this night, I see you as you are and I never want to leave. No more words from my lips. Just the look in your eyes says it all so much more than I could ever. I won't try. After the sunset disappears, when there's no one around, and there's nowhere but here. O, my love, let's keep this up as long as we're breathing. Forgetting the world outside of this room while you're holding me close, while I'm holding on to you. O, my love, let's keep this up as long as our hearts are beating. As long as our hearts are beating. My bride, my bride, there's something holding us together with you by my side. Everything fits so much better. I remember when you told me that you loved me for the very first time with those tears in your eyes. So beautiful, and now you're mine. After the sunset disappears, when there's no one around, and there's nowhere but here. O, my love, let's keep this up as long as we're breathing. Forgetting the world outside of this room while you're holding me close, while I'm holding on to you. O, my love, let's keep this up, let's keep this up. After the sunset disappears, when there's no one around, when there's nowhere but here. O, my love, let's keep this up, forgetting the world outside of this room while you're holding me close, while I'm holding on to you. O, my love, let's keep this up as long as our hearts are beating. As long as our hearts are beating. My bride, my bride, I can hardly hold myself together.	7
	I Was Made For Loving You	Tori Kelly ft. Ed Sheeran				A dangerous plan, just this time. A stranger's hand clutched in mine. I'll take this chance, so call me blind. I've been waiting all my life. Please don't scar this young heart, just take my hand. I was made for loving you even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through. Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do. All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you. Hold me close through the night, don't let me go, we'll be alright. Touch my soul and hold it tight. I've been waiting all my life. I won't scar your young heart, just take my hand. Cause I was made for loving you even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through. Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do. All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you. Please don't go, I've been waiting so long, oh, you don't even know me at all, but I was made for loving you.

	Can't Help Falling In Love	Kinna Grannis				Wise men say, "Only fools rush in." But I can't help falling in love with you. Shall I stay? Would it be a sin? If I can't help falling in love with you. Like a river flows surely to the sea, darling, so it goes some things are meant to be. Take my hand, take my whole life, too, for I can't help falling in love with you. Like a river flows surely to the sea, darling, so it goes some things are meant to be. Take my hand, take my whole life, too, for I can't help falling in love with you. For I can't help falling in love with you.	13
	As Time Goes By	Dooley Wilson				You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss. A sigh is just a sigh. The fundamental things apply as time goes by and when two lovers woo, they still say "I love you". On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings as time goes by, moonlight and love songs never out of date. Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate. Woman needs man, and man must have his mate that no one can deny. It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory. A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers as time goes by, moonlight and love songs never out of date. Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate. Woman needs man, and man must have his mate that no one can deny. It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory. A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers as time goes by.	12
	The Way You Look Tonight	Frank Sinatra				Some day when I'm awfully low, when the world is cold, I will feel a glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight. You're lovely with your smile, so warm and your cheeks so soft. There is nothing for me but to love you and the way you look tonight. With each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart. Lovely, never ever change. Keep that breathless charm, won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you just the way you look tonight. With each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart. You're lovely, don't you ever change. Keep that breathless charm, don't you please arrange it. Cause I love you just the way you look tonight. Tonight.	12
	Waiting For The Miracle	Leonard Cohen				Baby, I've been waiting, I've been waiting night and day. I didn't see the time, I waited half my life away. There were lots of invitations, and I know you sent me some, but I was waiting for the miracle, for the miracle to come. I know you really loved me, but you see, my hands were tied. I know it must have hurt you, it must have hurt your pride to have to stand beneath my window with your bugle and your drum, and me I'm up there waiting for the miracle, for the miracle to come. Ah, I don't believe you'd like it, you wouldn't like it here. There ain't no entertainment, and the judgments are severe. The Maestro says it's Mozart, but it sounds like bubble gum when you're waiting for the miracle, for the miracle to come. Waiting for the miracle. There's nothing left to do. I haven't been this happy since the end of World War II. Nothing left to do when you know that you've been taken. Nothing left to do when you're begging for a crumb. Nothing left to do when you've got to go on waiting, waiting for the miracle to come. I dreamed about you, baby. It was just the other night. Most of you was naked. Ah, but some of you was light. The sands of time were falling from your fingers and your thumb, and you were waiting for the miracle, for the miracle to come. Ah, baby, let's get married, we've been alone too long. Let's be alone together. Let's see if we're that strong. Yeah, let's do something crazy, something absolutely wrong while we're waiting for the miracle, for the miracle to come. Nothing left to do. When you've fallen on the highway, and you're lying in the rain, and they ask you how you're doing, of course, you'll say you can't complain. If you're squeezed for information, that's when you've got to play it dumb. You just say you're out there waiting for the miracle, for the miracle to come.	6.5
	I'll Follow You	Shinedown				If I could find assurance to leave you behind, I know my better half would fade. And all my doubts is a staircase for you opened out of this base. The first step is the one you believe in. The second one might be profound. I'll follow you down to the eye of the storm, don't worry, I'll keep you warm. I'll follow you down while we are passing through space. I don't care if we fall from grace, I'll follow you down. You can have the money and the world, the angels and the pearls, even trade my heart for color blue. Just like the tower we never built and the shadow of all the guilt. When the other hand was pointing at you. Yet, the first step is the one you believe in. The second one might be profound. I'll follow you down to the eye of the storm, don't worry, I'll keep you warm. I'll follow you down while we are passing through space. I don't care if we fall from grace, I'll follow you down to where forever lies. Without a doubt I'm on your side, there is nowhere else I'd rather be. I'm not about to compromise. Give you up to say goodbye. I've got you through the deep, I'll keep you close to me. I'll follow you down to the eye of the storm, don't worry, I'll keep you warm I'll follow you down while we are passing through space. I don't care if we fall from grace, I'll follow you. If I could find assurance to leave you behind. I know my better would fade, I'll follow you down.	7.5
	The Look Of Love	Diana Krall				The look of love is in your eyes, a look your smile can't disguise. The look of love is saying so much more than just words could ever say, and what my heart has heard, well, it takes my breath away. I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you. How long I have waited, waited just to love you, now that I have found you. You've got the look of love. It's on your face, a look that time can't erase. Be mine tonight, let this be just the start of so many nights like this. Let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss. I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you. How long I have waited, waited just to love you, now that I have found you. Don't ever go. Don't ever go. I love you so.	11
	Always Remember Us This Way	Lady Gaga				That Arizona sky burning in your eyes. You look at me, and babe, I wanna catch on fire. It's buried in my soul like California gold, you found the light in me, that I couldn't find. So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words every time we say goodbye. Baby, it hurts when the sun goes down, and the band won't play. I'll always remember us this way. Lovers in the night, poets trying to write. We don't know how to rhyme, but damn we try. But all I really know, you're where I wanna go. The part of me that's you will never die. So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words every time we say goodbye. Baby, it hurts when the sun goes down, and the band won't play. I'll always remember us this way. Oh, yeah, I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah. So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words every time we say goodbye. Baby, it hurts when the sun goes down, and the band won't play. I'll always remember us this way, oh, yeah. When you look at me and the whole world fades, I'll always remember us this way.	9
	I Will Always Love You	Whitney Houston				If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way. And I will always love you. I will always love you. You, my darling you, hm. Bittersweet memories that is all I'm taking with me. So goodbye, please don't cry. We both know I'm not what you, you need. And I will always love you. I will always love you, you. I hope life treats you kind, and I hope you have all you've dreamed of, and I wish to you joy and happiness, but above all this, I wish you, love. And I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you, I, I will always love you, you. Darling, I love you. Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you.	11
	Amazing Grace	Celtic Woman				Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I am found. Was blind, but now I see. T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come, 'tis grace has brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home. The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be, as long as life endures. Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail. And mortal life shall cease; I shall possess within the veil, a life of joy and peace. When we've been there ten thousand years. Bright shining as the sun; we've no less days to sing God's praise, than when we've first begun.	11
	I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You	Marc Anthony & Tina Arena				Moon so bright, night so fine, keep your heart, here with mine. Life's a dream, we are dreaming. Race the moon, catch the wind, ride the night to the end. Seize the day, stand up for the light. I want to spend my lifetime loving you if that is all in life I ever do. Heroes rise, heroes fall. Rise again, win it all. In your heart, can't you feel the glory? Through our joy, through our pain, we can move worlds again. Take my hand, dance with me. I want to spend my lifetime loving you if that is all in life I ever do. I will want nothing else to see me through if I can spend my lifetime loving you. Though we know, we will never come again. Where there is love, life begins. Over and over again. Save the night, save the day, save the love, come what may. Love is worth everything we pay. I want to spend my lifetime loving you if that is all in life I ever do. I want to spend my lifetime loving you if that is all in life I ever do. I will want nothing else to see me through if I can spend my lifetime loving you.	9
	Change Your Name	Brett Young				When you see somebody who erases everybody in the room. I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do, that's what you did to me when I saw you. Under strung-up white lights, dancin' all alone. I wanna know you like. I know every road back home. From that first tell-all, I knew that I'd never, I'd never let you go. Oh, I, I don't wanna change who you are. I don't wanna mess with your dreams or get in the way of who you wanna be. No, I, I won't stop your runaway heart. I just wanna be why you stay. Only thing about you that I'd change is, I'd change your name. I can't see 20 years from now. Hell, I can barely see today. Can't promise you your sky won't drop a little rain when that smile in the mirror disappears, I promise you I'll be right here. Oh, I, I don't wanna change who you are. I don't wanna mess with your dreams or get in the way of who you wanna be. No, I, I won't stop your runaway heart. I just wanna be why you stay. Only thing about you that I'd change is, I'd change your name. I'd change the face you see when you open up your eyes. I'd change the lips you kiss when you say goodnight for the rest of your life. Oh, I, I don't wanna change who you are. I don't wanna mess with your dreams or get in the way of who you wanna be. No, I, I won't stop your runaway heart. I just wanna be why you stay. Only thing about you that I'd change is, I'd change your name. Change your name. Mmm.	7.5
	Lay Your Heart Next To Mine	Steve Azar				It sure is good to see your smile at the end of a long hard day. Life out there is easier to bear when you look at me this way. I can't count the times you dance through my mind. While I'm tryin' to be who I am, but you got to believe. I'm not really me, 'til I'm back in your arms again. 'Cause it all comes clear when we're both right here, and you lay your heart next to mine. I'll never get used to those short goodbyes as I'm runnin' out the door, and I'll always hate walkin' away while you're tryin' to kiss me once more. But I've got to do what I've got to do and even when it don't go like I plan. I tell myself if there's nothin' else when every day comes to an end. It will be all right when you hold me tight, and you lay your heart next to mine. 'Cause every beat, every breath that I have you here with me, it is worth all the rest, oh, yes and every dream in my mind, comes alive every night, every time. And the world stands still. That's the way it feels when you lay your heart next to mine. Come and lay your heart next to mine.	9
	Samba Pa Ti by Santana (English Version)	Santana				I am the shadow of a shame. I am the echo of a pain. Sad, loneliness, what I have left today. The memory that I loved you and a strange desolation, hey, hey. I am the shadow of a shame. I am the echo of a pain. I want to forget. I want to find forgiveness. Have mercy on my heart, I implore you, my Lord, I will erase the darkness and hide my tears. The memory I suffer will become a song. I'll come back to life, I'll sing again, you'll see. I'll come back to life, I'll sing again, you'll see.	14
	Blessed	Thomas Rhett				Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do. Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you. You're too good for coincidence and too perfect for an accident. I'm not sure where heaven is, but every night I get a glimpse, and I know I'm blessed. Watching you spin in that dress, make my heart beat out my chest. I can't count the times I've heard people say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word. Oh, I'm blessed, and all I ain't got is my breath. You stole it the first time we met. You're more than I deserve, people say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word. Oh, I, I keep checking you for halos. Swear you're an angel in disguise. You pull my mind from every angle, and I can see heaven in your eyes. You're too good for coincidence and too perfect for an accident. I'm not sure where heaven is, but every night I get a glimpse, and I know I'm blessed (blessed). Watching you spin in that dress (dress), make my heart beat out my chest. I can't count the times I've heard people say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word. Oh, I'm blessed (blessed), and all I ain't got is my breath (breath). You stole it the first time we met. You're more than I deserve, people say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word. Oh, I, Baby, you're the kinda girl that I'm always praying for, and I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful. Oh, baby, 'cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees). Whoa, you make me believe. Baby, I'm blessed (blessed). Watching you spin in that dress (dress) make my heart beat out my chest. I can't count the times I've heard people say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word. Oh, I'm blessed (blessed), and all I ain't got is my breath (breath). You stole it the first time we met. You're more than I deserve, people say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word. Oh, I'm blessed.	7
	Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters	Elton John				And now I know, Spanish Harlem are not just pretty words to say. I thought I knew, but now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City until you've seen this trash can dream come true. You stand at the edge while people run you through, and I thank the Lord there's people out there like you. I thank the Lord there's people out there like you. While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters, sons of bankers, sons of lawyers turn around and say good morning to the night. For unless they see the sky but they can't, and that is why they know not if it's dark outside or light. This Broadway's got, it's got a lot of songs to sing. If I knew the tunes I might join in. I'll go my way alone, grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City. Subway's no way for a good man to go down. Rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown, and I thank the Lord for the people I have found. I thank the Lord for the people I have found.	9
	This Magic Moment	The Drifters				This magic moment, so different and so new but like any other until I kissed you. And then it happened, it took me by surprise. I knew that you felt it too by the look in your eyes. Sweeter than wine, softer than the summer night. Everything I want I have whenever I hold you tight. This magic moment while your lips are close to mine. Will last forever, forever till the end of time. Sweeter than wine, softer than the summer night. Everything I want I have whenever I hold you tight. This magic moment while your lips are close to mine. Will last forever, forever till the end of time. Magic moment.	12
	Can't Fight This Feeling	Reo Speedwagon				I can't fight this feeling any longer, and yet I'm still afraid to let it flow. What started out as friendship has grown stronger. I only wish I had the strength to let it show. I tell myself that I can't hold out forever. I said there is no reason for my fear 'cause I feel so secure when we're together. You give my life direction, you make everything so clear, and even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight. You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night and I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might, and I can't fight this feeling anymore. I've forgotten what I started fighting for. It's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars, forever. 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore, I've forgotten what I started fighting for. And if I have to crawl upon the floor, come crashing through your door, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore. My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you. I've been running round in circles in my mind, and it always seems that I'm following you, girl 'cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find. And even as I wander, I'm keeping you sight. You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night. And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might, and I can't fight this feeling anymore. I've forgotten what I started fighting for. It's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars, forever. 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore, I've forgotten what I started fighting for, and if I have to crawl upon the floor, come crashing through your door. Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore.	7
	Something In The Way She Moves	James Taylor				Something in the way she moves, or looks my way, or calls my name. That seems to leave this troubled world behind, and if I'm feeling down and blue or troubled by some foolish game, she always seems to make me change my mind. And I feel fine anytime she's around me now, she's around me now almost all the time. And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now, she's been with me now quite a long, long time and I feel fine. Every now, and then the things I lean on lose their meaning, and I find myself careening in places where I should not let me go. She has the power to go where no one else can find me and to silently remind me of the happiness and the good times that I know, and then I just got to go then. It isn't what she's got to say but how she thinks and where she's been. To me, the words are nice, the way they sound. I like to hear them best that way, it doesn't much matter what they mean. She says them mostly just to calm me down, and I feel fine anytime she's around me now. She's around me now almost all the time, and if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now. She's been with me now quite a long, long time and I feel fine.	8
	Walking with Angels	Tome Nikolov				The winter wind blows cold outside. In my heart, the sun forever shines. I touch your skin frozen in time if this world should end this moment's yours and mine. I took some to find what was missing in my life. I still can't believe you're mine. 'Cause I'm walking with angels when I'm walking with you. Yes, I'm walking with angels, it's true. I found heaven on the day that I found you. I'm in heaven every moment I'm with you. I've been down, I've been worse and low. Thinking I would always walk this world alone. Now it's hard to comprehend cause when I met you I was born again. Still, now I have my doubts that one day this all will end, but each moment till then I'll be walking with angels when I'm walking with you. Yes, I'm walking with angels, it's true. I found heaven on the day that I found you. I'm in heaven every moment I'm with you. You are my hope. You're the reason I breathe. You'll never know how you saved me and that you made me believe.	10

I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom. I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume. I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme. Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time. Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time.	13

	You Matter To Me	Sara Bareilles				I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes. They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear, come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you.

I promise you do, you see? You matter to me. It's addictive the minute you let yourself think. The things that I say just might matter to someone. All of this time, I've been keeping my mind on the running away, and for the first time, I think I'd consider the stay because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody, you matter to me. I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see? You matter to me, and you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody, you matter to me. I promise you do, you (out of hiding I'm right here beside you), you matter too (As long as you have me.)

You matter to me.	8

	Look At Us	Vince Gill				Look at us, after all these years together. Look at us, after all that we've been through. Look at us, still leaning on each other.

So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now. Sure, we changed, but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me. I went to the store and I bought you a ring, and I got down on one knee. Down on one knee and I said, "I wanna be yours forever. So, baby, will you be my wife? Now that we know a little better.

	The Thunder Rolls	Garth Brooks				Three-thirty in the morning, not a soul in sight. The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night. Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm moving in. He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been. And the thunder rolls. And the thunder rolls. Every light is burnin' in a house across town. She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown. Askin' for a miracle, and hopin' she's not right. Prayin' it's the weather that has kept him out all night. And the thunder rolls. And the thunder rolls. The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes. Another love grows cold on a sleepless night. As the storm blows on out of control. Deep in her heart the thunder rolls. She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive. She rushes out to hold him thankful he's alive, but on the wind and rain, a strange new perfume blows. And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows. And the thunder rolls. And the thunder rolls. The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes. Another love grows cold on a sleepless night. As the storm blows on out of control. Deep in her heart the thunder rolls.	8

	Grace	Jim McCann				As we gather in the chapel here in old Kilmainham Gaol, I think about these past few weeks, oh, will they say, we've failed? From our school days, they have told us we must yearn. For liberty, yet, all I want in this dark place is to have you here with me. Oh, Grace, just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger, they'll take me out at dawn, and I will die. With all my love, I place this wedding ring upon your finger, there won't be time to share our love for we must say good-bye. Now, I know it's hard for you, my love, to ever understand, the love I bear for these brave men, my love for this dear land, but when Pádhraic called me to his side down in the G.P.O., I had to leave my own sick bed, to him I had to go. Oh, Grace, just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger, they'll take me out at dawn, and I will die. With all my love, I place this wedding ring upon your finger, there won't be time to share our love for we must say good-bye. Now, as the dawn is breaking, my heart is breaking, too, on this May morn, as I walk out, my thoughts will be of you, and I'll write some words upon the wall so everyone will know, I love so much that I could see his blood upon the rose. Oh, Grace, just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger, they'll take me out at dawn now I must die. With all my love, I place this wedding ring upon your finger, there won't be time to share our love for we must say good-bye.	7.5

March 6	Promise	Romeo Santos ft. Usher				I've been walking the wire over your love, and I've fallen into your hands, but I don't know where I'll land. Your body holds me, hostage, whenever I touch you. I'm a prisoner inside, baby til' the end of time. Try to keep my balance, but I still fall but how'd I fell so hard right into your arms, I swear.

I'll give you my heart girl, but you got to promise (Ay prometeme mami). Promise you'll hold me (hold me), oh touch me (oh touch me), love me way past forever. You need this in your life (Yeah man).

March 6	Yours	Russell Dickerson				I was a boat stuck in a bottle that never got the chance to touch the sea. Just forgot on the shelf. No wind in the sails, going nowhere with no one but me. I was one in a hundred billion, a burned-out star in a galaxy. Just lost in the sky, wondering why everyone else shines out but me. But I came to life when I first kissed you. The best me has his arms around you. You make me better than I was before, thank God I'm yours. I was a worn-out set of shoes, wandering the city street. Another face in the crowd, head looking down, lost in the sound of a lonely melody. Empty pockets at a roulette, always landing on a lost bet, just live for the spin and hope for the win, go all in just to lose again. But I came to life when I first kissed you, the best me has his arms around you. You make me better than I was before, thank God I'm yours. The worst me is just a long-gone memory. You put a new heartbeat inside of me. You make me better than I was before, thank God I'm yours. I was a boat stuck in a bottle that never got the chance to touch the sea.

March 6	This Old Love	Lior				Yes, yeah, we're movin' on. Looking for direction, mmm, mm, we've covered much ground, Thinking back to innocence I can no longer connect. I don' t have a heart left to throw around. Oh, and time moves on like a train that disappears into the night sky. Yeah, I still get a sad feeling inside to see the red tail lights wave goodbye. We'll grow old together. We'll grow old together, and this love will never. This old love will never die. Well, money slips into your hands and then slips out like it was sand. And those shoes that you could never seem to fill I've chased so much and lost my way. Maybe a face for every day that so casually slipped me by. Oh, and time moves on like a train that disappears into the night sky. Yeah, I still get that sad feelin' inside to see the red tail lights wave goodbye. We'll grow old together. We'll grow old together, and this love will never. This old love will never die. Morning comes sometimes with a smile, sometimes with a frown.

Yes, yeah, we're movin' on, movin' right along.	8
March 6	Extraordinary Magic	Ben Recto				You won't believe it and strange as it sounds, extraordinary magic follows you around, and the camera can't catch it, you won't see it in the mirror if I say look behind you, you turn around, it disappears. But I see it, I see it, I swear I do. I see extraordinary magic in you. Out of thin air, you appeared in my life, like a burst of Technicolor in a world of black and white. When my heart was locked inside a box you reached inside, and now, I see my future when I look into your eyes. I see it, I see it, I swear I do. I see extraordinary magic in you. And I know that miracles happen who cares what they say. Is love nothing short of a miracle happening over and over every day? So I'll keep my eyes open, awed and amazed, and if you start to doubt it I'll remind you of the million ways. I see it, I see it, I swear I do. I see extraordinary magic in you.	10
March 6	Hold On To Me	John Michael Montgomery				I wanna wake up each morning with you for the rest of my life.  I wanna feel your heart beating and just get lost in your eyes. You can tell me your secrets. You can let me feel your pain. You can show me your weakness and never be ashamed. Hold on to me when your world's turnin' cold when it feels like your life's spinnin' out of control, you're hopin', prayin', tryin' so hard to believe. Hold on to me when there's no middle ground, and every emotion is comin' unwound. And you don't know if you can hold on to your dreams. Baby, you can hold on to me. I wanna lay down each evenin' with you right here by my side. I wanna get drunk on your laughter and wipe all the tears when you cry. You can scare me with your darkness. You can blind me with your light. Throw your worries out the window, baby on your wildest night. Hold on to me when your world's turnin' cold when it feels like your life's spinnin' out of control, you're hopin', prayin', tryin' so hard to believe.

March 6	I Have Always Loved You	Enrique Iglesias				Since the beginning of time, since it started to rain, since I heard your laugh, since I felt your pain, I was too young, you were much younger, we were afraid of each other's hunger. I have always loved you. There's never been anyone else. I knew you before I knew myself. Oh, my baby, I have always loved you. Since we kissed the first time, since we slept on the beach, you were too close for comfort, you were too far out of reach. You walked away, I should have held you. Would you have stayed for me to tell you? I have always loved you. There's never been anyone else. I knew you before I knew myself. Oh, my baby, I have always loved you. Years go by in a matter of days, and though we go our separate ways. I never stop dreaming of you. I have always loved you. When you call, it makes me cry. We never made time for you and I. If I could live it all again, I'd never let it end, I'd still be with you. Oh, God, I miss you. I have always loved you. I knew you before I knew myself. Oh my baby, I have always loved you. Years go by in a matter of days, and though we go our separate ways. I never stop dreaming of you. I have always loved you. I have always loved you. I have always loved you. I have always loved you.	8
March 6	I Have Always Loved You	Addison Road				You are a fire; that lights the night. You are forgiveness; that heals hearts, even mine. Only in you are we free; only in you can we see.

March 6	You're The Inspiration	Peter Cetera				You know our love was meant to be, the kind of love to last forever. And I want you here with me from tonight until the end of time.

March 6	I Knew I Loved You	Savage Garden				Maybe it's intuition, but some things you just don't question. Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant, and there it goes, I think I found my best friend. I know that it might sound more than a little crazy, but I believe. I knew I loved you before I met you. I think I dreamed you into life. I knew I loved you before I met you. I have been waiting all my life. There's just no rhyme or reason, only the sense of completion, and in your eyes, I see the missing pieces I'm searching for, I think I've found my way home. I know that it might sound more than a little crazy, but I believe. I knew I loved you before I met you. I think I dreamed you into life. I knew I loved you before I met you. I have been waiting all my life. A thousand angels dance around you. I am complete now that I've found you. I knew I loved you before I met you. I think I dreamed you into life. I knew I loved you before I met you. I have been waiting all my life. I knew I loved you before I met you. I think I dreamed you into life. I knew I loved you before I met you.

	Unanswered Prayers	Garth Brooks				Just the other night, at a hometown football game. My wife and I ran into my old high school flame, and as I introduced them, the past came back to me. And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be. She was the one that I'd wanted for all times, and each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine. And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then. I'd never ask for anything again. Sometimes, I thank God for unanswered prayers. Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs and just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care. Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers. She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams. And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed. We tried to talk about the old days there wasn't much we could recall. I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all. And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife and then, and there I thanked, the good Lord, for the gifts in my life. Sometimes, I thank God for unanswered prayers. Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs, and just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care. Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered. Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered. Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.	8
	I've Always Loved You	Third Day				I don't know how to explain it, but I know the words would hardly do. Miracles and signs and wonders aren't enough for me to prove to you. Don't you know I've always loved you? Even before, there was time though you turn away I tell you still, "Don't you know I've always loved you? And I always will." Greater love has not a man than the one who gives his life to prove that he would do anything, and that's what I'm gonna do for you. Don't you know I've always loved you? Even before, there was time though you turn away I tell you still, "Don't you know I've always loved you? And I always will." Don't you know I've always loved you? Even before, there was time though you turn away I tell you still, "Don't you know I've always loved you? And I always will." Don't you know I've always loved you? Even before, there was time though you turn away I tell you still, "Don't you know I've always loved you? And I always will." I've always loved you, oh, and I always will. I've always loved you, and I always will. I've always loved you, oh, and I always, and I always will. I've always loved you.	8.5
	I.O.U	Lee Greenwood				You believe that I've changed your life forever. And you're never gonna find another somebody like me. And you wish, you had more than just a lifetime to give back all I've given you, and that's what you believe. But I owe you the sunlight in the morning, and the nights of all this loving that time can't take away. And I owe you more than life now, more than ever. I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay. I'm amazed when you say it's me you live for. You know that when I'm holding you, you're right where you belong. And my love, I can't help but smile with wonder when you tell me all I've done for you. 'Cause I've known all along, but I owe you the sunlight in the morning, and the nights of all this loving that time can't take away. And I owe you more than life now, more than ever. I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay. 'Cause I owe you the sunlight in the morning, and the nights of all this loving that time can't take away. And I owe you more than life now, more than ever. I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay.	9
	From Here To The Moon and Back	Dolly Parton				I could hold out my arms say, "I love you this much," I could tell you how long I will long for your touch. How much and how far would I go to prove the depth and the breadth of my love for you? From here to the moon and back. Who else in this world will love you like that? Love everlasting, I promise you that, from here to the moon and back, from here to the moon and back. I want you to know you can always depend on promises made and love without end. No need to wonder how faithful I'll be. Now and on into eternity. From here to the moon and back. Who else in this world will love you like that?

And I'll spend forever just proving that fact, from here to the moon and back.	9
	That's Why (I Love You)	Jackie Wilson				The way you make me feel like I belong. The way you make me right when I am wrong. The way you sacrifice just for me. Just how lucky can a poor man be? That is why (that's why I love you so), that is why (that's why I love you so). Don't you know, baby? (that's why I love you so) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know. The way you rub my back when I'm in pain. The way you soothe me so I won't complain. And when you kiss me with your ruby-red lips, it thrills me.  So I turn a back-over flip. That is why (that's why I love you so). Don't you know, baby? (that's why I love you so) That is why (that's why I love you so). Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know. If Shakespeare thought that Juliet really loved Romeo from the time they met. He would blow his top if he could see just how you've been lovin' me. The way you rub my back when I'm in pain. The way you soothe me so I won't complain. And when you kiss me with your ruby-red lips, it thrills me. So I turn a back-over flip. That is why (that's why I love you so), that is why (that's why I love you so). C'mon now, baby. (that's why I love you so) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to take it easy, baby (that's why I love you so). Take it easy, honey (that's why I love you so). Don't you know now (that's why I love you so). Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the, one more time, now (that's why I love you so). C'mon, c'mon, baby (that's why I love you so).	7.5

	Longer	Dan Fogelberg				Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean. Higher than any bird ever flew. Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens. I've been in love with you. Stronger than any mountain cathedral, truer than any tree ever grew, deeper than any forest primeval - I am in love with you. I'll bring fire in the winters. You'll send showers in the springs. We'll fly through the falls and summers with love on our wings. Through the years, as the fire starts to mellow. Burning lines in the book of our lives. Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow, I'll be in love with you, I'll be in love with you. Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean, higher than any bird ever flew, longer than there've been stars up in the heavens. I've been in love with you, I am in love with you.	10
	You're My Home	Billy Joel				When you look into my eyes, and you see the crazy gypsy in my soul. It always comes as a surprise when I feel my withered roots begin to grow. Well, I never had a place that I could call my very own. That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home. When you touch my weary head, and you tell me everything will be all right. you say, "Use my body for your bed, and my love will keep you warm throughout the night." Well, I'll never be a stranger, and I'll never be alone wherever we're together, that's my home. Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Indiana's early morning dew. High up in the hills of California, home is just another word for you. Well, I never had a place that I could call my very own. That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home. If I travel all my life and I never get to stop and settle down. Long as I have you by my side, there's a roof above and good walls all around. You're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome. I need you in my house 'cause you're my home. You're my home.	9
	Have I Told You Lately That I Love You	Van Morrison				Have I told you lately that I love you? Have I told you there's no one else above you? Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness.

There's just a few more days to labor then I will take my heavenly flight. Beulah Land, I'm longing for you, and someday on thee, I'll stand. There my home shall be eternal. Beulah Land - Sweet Beulah Land.	11

Just the two of us building castles in the sky. Just the two of us.  I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall, and it becomes the morning dew. Darling, when the morning comes, and I see the morning sun, I want to be the one with you. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try. Just the two of us. Just the two of us building big castles way on high. Just the two of us, you and I. Just the two of us. Let's get together, baby, just the two of us. We can make it, just the two of us. We can make it, just the two of us. Just the two of us. We can make it.	8

	Say You Won’t Let Go	James Arthur				I met you in the dark, you lit me up. You made me feel as though I was enough. We danced the night away, we drank too much. I held your hair back when you were throwing up then you smiled over your shoulder. For a minute I was stone-cold sober. I pulled you closer to my chest, and you asked me to stay over. I said, I already told ya, I think that you should get some rest. I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know 'cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go. I know I needed you, but I never showed. But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old, just say you won't let go. Just say you won't let go. I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed. I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head, and I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye. And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night then you looked over your shoulder. For a minute, I forget that I'm older, I wanna dance with you right now. Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever, and I swear that every day you'll get better. You make me feel this way somehow.

	Nights Are Forever Without You	Dan Seals & John Ford Coley				Lying in bed with the radio on. Moonlight falls like rain. Soft summer nights spent thinking of you, when will I see you again. Soft and low the music moans, I can't stop thinking about you, thinking 'bout you. I didn't know it would be so strong. Waiting and wondering about you. I didn't know it would last so long, nights are forever without you. Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky. The sun will be coming up soon, but I just can't sleep for thinking of you. Here alone with the moon. Soft and low the music moans, I can't stop thinking about you, thinking 'bout you. I didn't know it would be so strong. Waiting and wondering about you. I didn't know it would last so long, nights are forever without you. Nights are forever without you. Nights are forever without you. Nights are forever without you. Nights are forever without you.	10
	Life Is A Highway	Tom Cochrane				Love's like a road that you travel on when there's one day here and the next day gone. Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand, sometimes you turn your back to the wind. There's a world outside every darkened door where blues won't haunt you anymore, where the brave are free, and lovers soar. Come ride with me to the distant shore. We won't hesitate. Break down the garden gate. There's not much time left today. Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long. If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long. Through all these cities and all these towns, it's in my blood, and it's all around. I loved you now like I loved you then. This is the road, and these are the hills from Mozambique to those Memphis nights, the Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights. Knock me down, back up again. You're in my blood; I'm not a lonely man. There's no load I can't hold. Road so rough, this I know. I'll be there when the light comes in. Just tell 'em we're survivors. Life is a highway. I wanna ride it all night long. If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long. Life is a highway. I wanna ride it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!) If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long. There was a distance between you and I. A misunderstanding once, but now we look it in the eye (oh!) There ain't no load that I can't hold. Road so rough, this I know. I'll be there when the light comes in. Just tell 'em we're survivors. Life is a highway. I wanna ride it all night long. If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!) Life is a highway. I wanna ride it all night long. If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!) Life is a highway. I wanna ride it all night long. If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!)	6.5
	We've Only Just Begun	The Carpenters				We've only just begun to live. White lace and promises, a kiss for luck and we're on our way. We've only begun. Before the rising sun, we fly so many roads to choose. We start out walking and learn to run, and yes, we've just begun. Sharing horizons that are new to us, watching the signs along the way. Talking it over just the two of us, working together day to day, together. And when the evening comes, we smile. So much of life ahead, we'll find a place where there's room to grow, and yes, we've just begun.	13
	Stairway To Heaven	Led Zeppelin				There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed. With a word, she can get what she came for. Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings. Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. Ooh, it makes me wonder, ooh, it makes me wonder. There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, and the voices of those who stand looking. Ooh, it makes me wonder, ooh, it really makes me wonder. And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune, then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn for those who stand long, and the forests will echo with laughter. If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, it's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder. Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know, the piper's calling you to join him. Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know your stairway lies on the whispering wind? And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know, who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last. When all are one, and one is all to be a rock and not to roll. And she's buying a stairway to heaven.	7
	Never Let You Go	Steelheart				Angel eyes, you have angel eyes, such a smile that lights up my life. You're a dream come true, now I'm holding you, and I'll never, never let you go, I will never let you go! First time I laid my eyes upon you, all my dreams were answered. First time I kissed your tender lips, my love, to you I surrendered. I'll never let you go. You're always on my mind. You're the only one for me, you're all I need, and I'll never, never let you go. Angel eyes, my heart relies on the love you give to me. You never let me down, you're always by my side, and I'll never, never let you go, I will never let you go! When my heart starts to crumble, and the tears start to fall, you hold me close with tender lovin', and give me strength to carry on. I'll never let you go. You're always on my mind. You're the only one for me, you're all I need, and I'll never, never let you go. I'll never let you go. You're always on my mind. You're the only one for me, you're all I need, and I'll never, never let you go. And I'll never, never let you go.	9
	Perfect Symphony	Jann Arden				This is life. Nobody gonna tell you that you're never gonna look into. This is it. Nobody gonna show you that the end is ever something that you're gonna survive. This is all. Nobody ever gonna figure out what makes a perfectly symmetrical line. It really is. Nobody gonna tell you that you're never gonna look into.

March 11	You Light Up My Life	LeAnn Rimes				So many nights, I'd sit by my window, waiting for someone to sing me his song. So many dreams, I kept deep inside me, alone in the dark, but now you've come along. And you light up my life, you give me hope, to carry on. You light up my days and fill my nights with song. Rollin' at sea, adrift on the waters. Could it be finally, I'm turning for home. Finally a chance to say, "Hey, I Love You". Never again to be all alone. And you light up my life, you give me hope, to carry on. You light up my days and fill my nights with song. You, you light up my life. You give me hope to carry on.

I wanted more than life could ever grant me. Bored by the chore of saving face. Today is the greatest day I've never known. Can't wait for tomorrow, I might not have that long. I'll tear my heart out before I get out. Pink ribbon scars that never forget. I tried so hard to cleanse these regrets. My angel wings were bruised and restrained. My belly stings. Today is, today is, today is the greatest day. I want to turn you on. I want to turn you on. I want to turn you on. I want to turn you. Today is the greatest. Today is the greatest day. Today is the greatest day that I have ever really known.	11
	I'll Still Be Loving You	Restless Heart				Changin' my life with your love has been so easy for you, and I'm amazed every day. And I'll need you 'till all the mountains are valleys, and every ocean is dry, my love. I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine, 'till time stands still until the winds don't blow. When today is just a memory to me, I know I'll still be loving, I'll still be loving you, I'll still be loving you. Never before did I know how loving someone could be. Now I can see, you and me for a lifetime, until the last moon is rising. You'll see the love in my eyes, my love. I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine, 'till time stands still until the winds don't blow. When today is just a memory to me, I know I'll still be loving. I'll still be loving you. I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine, 'till time stands still until the winds don't blow. When today is just a memory to me, I know I'll still be loving, I'll still be loving you, I'll still be loving you. I'll still be loving, I'll still be loving you. I'll still be loving, I'll still be loving you. I'll still be loving, I'll still be loving you.	9

	Harvest Moon	Neil Young				Come a little bit closer, hear what I have to say. Just like children sleepin' we could dream this night away. But there's a full moon risin', let's go dancin' in the light. We know where the music's playin', let's go out and feel the night. Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again. Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon. When we were strangers, I watched you from afar. When we were lovers, I loved you with all my heart. But now it's gettin' late and the moon is climbin' high. I want to celebrate, see it shinin' in your eyes. Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again. Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon. Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again. Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon.	10
	Love Is Not A Fight	Warren Barfield				Love is not a place to come and go, as we please. It's a house we enter in and then commit to never leave. So lock the door behind you, throw away the key. We'll work it out together, let it bring us to our knees. Love is a shelter in a raging storm. Love is peace in the middle of a war. If we try to leave, may God send angels to guard the door. No, love is not a fight, but it's something worth fighting for. To some, love is a word that they can fall into, but when they're falling out, keeping their word is hard to do. Love is a shelter in a raging storm. Love is peace in the middle of a war. If we try to leave, may God send angels to guard the door. No, love is not a fight, but it's something worth fighting for. Love will come to save us if we'll only call. He will ask nothing from us, but demand we give our all. Love is a shelter in a raging storm. Love is peace in the middle of a war. If we try to leave, may God send angels to guard the door. No, love is not a fight, but it's something worth fighting for. I will fight for you. Would you fight for me? It's worth fighting for.	9
	Could I Have This Dance	Anne Murray				I'll always remember the song they were playin' the first time we danced. And I knew as we swayed to the music, and held to each other. I fell in love with you. Could I have this dance for the rest of my life? Would you be my partner every night? When we're together, it feels so right. Could I have this dance for the rest of my life? I'll always remember that magic moment when I held you close to me. As we moved together, I knew forever you're all I'll ever need. Could I have this dance for the rest of my life? Would you be my partner every night? When we're together, it feels so right. Could I have this dance for the rest of my life? Could I have this dance for the rest of my life? Would you be my partner every night? When we're together, it feels so right. Could I have this dance for the rest of my life?	10
	If I Should Fall Behind	Bruce Springsteen				We said we'd walk together, baby, come what may. That come the twilight should we lose our way. If as we're walking a hand should slip free. I'll wait for you and should I fall behind, wait for me. We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side. We'd help each other stay in stride. But each lover's steps fall so differently. But I'll wait for you and if I should fall behind, wait for me. Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true but you and I know what this world can do. So let's make our steps clear that the other may see and I'll wait for you. If I should fall behind, wait for me. Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead. There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed. Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees, I'll wait for you. And should I fall behind, wait for me. Darlin' I'll wait for you. Should I fall behind, wait for me.	10
	Unexpected Song	Hayley Westenra				I have never felt like this for once I'm lost for words. Your smile has really thrown me. This is not like me at all, I never thought I'd know the kind of love you've shown me. Now, no matter where I am, no matter what I do. I see your face appearing like an unexpected song. An unexpected song that only we are hearing. I don't know what's going on. Can't work it out at all whatever made you choose me? I just can't believe my eyes, you look at me as though you couldn't bare to lose me. Now, no matter where I am, no matter what I do. I see your face appearing like an unexpected song. An unexpected song that only we are hearing. I have never felt like this for once I'm lost for words. Your smile has really thrown me. This is not like me at all, I never thought I'd know the kind of love you've shown me. Now no matter where I am, no matter what I do. I see your face appearing like an unexpected song. An unexpected song that only we are hearing. Like an unexpected song. An unexpected song that only we are hearing.	9
	Cover Me Up	Jason Isbell				A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun, you can't trust anyone. I was so sure what I needed was more tried to shoot out the sun. Days when we raged, we flew off the page such damage was done, but I made it through, cause somebody knew I was meant for someone. So girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leaving this room. Till someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom. It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood. So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good. Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress in Richmond on high. But I sobered up, and I swore off that stuff forever, this time. And the old lovers sing “I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”, but home was a dream, one I'd never seen till you came along. So girl, hang your dress up to dry, we ain't leaving this room till Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through and carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood. Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good. So girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leaving this room till someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom. It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood. So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good. Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good.	8
	Sukiyaki	Taste Of Honey				It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue. You went away, now my life is just a rainy day. I love you so, how much you'll never know. You've gone away and left me lonely. Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me. Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue. But you disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears. I'm wishin' you were here with me. Soft with love are my thoughts of you. Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do. If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears. The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine. But in reality, you and I will never be 'cause you took your love away from me, oh. If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears. The sun would shine, once again you'd be mine, all mine. But in reality, you and I will never be 'cause you took your love away from me. Oh, baby, you took your love away from me. Sayonara.	10
	Hung The Moon	Ellie Holcomb				I like the way you hung the moon, uh-huh. Well, I just like being close to you, uh-huh. When you're gone I feel so blue, uh-huh. Yeah, I like the way you hung the moon, uh-huh. I like the way you know that dance, uh-huh. I like the way you hold my hand, uh-huh. Just spin me all across the floor, uh-huh. Yeah, I like the way you know that dance, uh-huh. Well, I like the way you sing your songs, uh-huh. You've been singing to me all along, uh-huh. The way you loved me won my heart, uh-huh. Yeah, I like the way you sing your songs, uh-huh. I put on that white dress for you, uh-huh. I told the preacher man, "Well, yes, I do." uh-huh. And I'll stay, and I'll grow gray with you, uh-huh. Yeah, I put on that white dress for you, uh-huh.	10
	I Finally Found Someone	Bryan Adams & Barbra Streisand				I finally found someone that knocks me off my feet. I finally found the one that makes me feel complete. It started over coffee, we started out as friends. It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin. This time it's different, ta, ra, ra, ra. It's all because of you, ta, ra, ra, ra. It's better than it's ever been, 'cause we can talk it through. My favorite line was, "Can I call you sometime?" It's all you had to say to take my breath away. This is it, oh, I finally found someone, someone to share my life. I finally found the one to be with every night. 'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you. My life has just begun, I finally found someone. Someone, I finally found someone. Did I keep you waiting? I didn't mind, I apologize, baby, that's fine. I would wait forever just to know you were mine. You know, I love your hair. Are you sure it looks right? I love what you wear. Isn't it too tight? You're exceptional, I can't wait for the rest of my life.  This is it, oh, I finally found someone, someone to share my life. I finally found the one to be with every night. 'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you. My life has just begun, I finally found someone. And whatever I do, it's just got to be you. My life has just begun, I finally found someone.	8
	Let It Be Me	Elvis Presley				God bless the day I found you. I want to stay around you, and so I beg you. Let it be me. Don't take this Heaven from one. Well if you must cling to someone, now and forever. Let it be me. Each time we meet love, I find complete love. Without your sweet love, tell me, what would life be? So never leave me lonely. Just tell me you love me only, and that you'll always. Let it be me. Each time we meet love, I find complete love. Oh, without your sweet love, tell me, what would life be? So never leave me lonely, and just tell me you love me only, and that you'll always. Let it be me. And that you'll always, let it be me. So never leave me lonely. Tell me you love me only, and that you'll always. Let it be me.	11
	After All	Peter Cetera / cher				Well, here we are again. I guess it must be fate. We've tried it on our own but deep inside we've known we'd be back to set things straight. I still remember when your kiss was so brand new. Every memory repeats, every step I take retreats, every journey always brings me back to you. After all the stops and starts, we keep coming back to these two hearts. Two angels who've been rescued from the fall. And after all that we've been through it all comes down to me and you. I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all. When love is truly right (this time it's truly right) it lives from year to year. It changes as it goes, oh, and on the way it grows but it never disappears. After all the stops and starts we keep coming back to these two hearts. Two angels who've been rescued from the fall and after all that we've been through. It all comes down to me and you. I guess it's meant to be forever you and me, after all. Always just beyond my touch, you know I needed you so much. After all, what else is livin' for? After all the stops and starts, we keep coming back to these two hearts. Two angels who've been rescued from the fall. And after all that we've been through, it all comes down to me and you. I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all.	8
	All The Things You Are	Frank Sinatra				You are the promised kiss of springtime that makes the lonely winter seem long. You are the breathless hush of evening that trembles on the brink of a lovely song. You are the angel glow that lights the star, the dearest things that I know are what you are. Someday, my happy arms will hold you, and someday I'll know that moment divine when all the things you are, are mine. You are the angel glow that lights the star, the dearest things that I know are what you are. Someday, my happy arms will hold you, and someday I'll know that moment divine when all the things you are, are mine.	12
	Pachelbel's Canon	Katherine Jenkins				You are my love, my life, my best chance to live free. My eyes, when I watch the sun setting over the sea, my lungs, when the cool breeze blows softly into me, you are my ears when I listen to Canon in D. My happiness you were, you are and always you will be. When you laugh, when you sing, when you cry and when you dream. When you are near or when you are far, you always will be, always were and always are, mi carino, my soul mate, my number one weakness and my greatest strength. When you were born, while you live, and long after you die, you were, you are and always will you be mine. My sweetest sweet, my dearest dear, my only trust, and hope after God, and my freedom of all fears. Always my love, no matter how far or how near. The oceans so vast as far as one can see under the sky so blue, and beyond all the mountains' highest peaks. So far, deep and long my love for you, so strong and lasting, so real and true. The beauty of your eyes looking into mine, your skin, your hair all so soft and so fine. How lucky am I that you could be all mine. This time, I now know as the cool autumn winds softly blow. I've said this all even before, just yesterday and long ago. So I stand now silent to all, for only she really knows, and the autumn breeze slowly soothes a once lost soul. Alas, my Angel, I have found and she has found me. So far, far away but still hear her heartbeat. Beyond all any hopes and more than any dream. I now believe in fate and see in destiny. The Lord has not left us, alone or lonely, for now, my Angel, I have found, and she has found me. I cannot put into all the words or have imagined or foreseen, how perfect we will feel together, and how I miss you every time you log off and leave.	7
March 16	Two is Better than One	Boys Like Girls ft. Taylor Swift				I remember what you wore on the first day. You came into my life, and I thought hey, you know, this could be something. 'Cause everything you do and words you say, you know that it all takes my breath away, and now I'm left with nothing. So maybe it's true that I can't live without you, and maybe two is better than one. But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life, and you've already got me coming undone, and I'm thinking two is better than one. I remember every look upon your face. The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste. You make it hard for breathing 'cause when I close my eyes and drift away, I think of you and everything's okay. I'm finally now believing. Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you. Maybe two is better than one, but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life, and you've already got me coming undone, and I'm thinking two is better than one. I remember what you wore on the first day. You came into my life and I thought, hey (hey, hey) Maybe it's true that I can't live without you. Maybe two is better than one. There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life, and you've already got me coming undone. And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you 'cause, baby, two is better than one. There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life, but I've figured out with all that's said and done. Two is better than one, two is better than one.	7.5
	Look What You’ve Done To Me	Boz Scaggs				Hope they never end this song. This could take us all night long. I looked at the moon, and I felt blue. Then I looked again, and I saw you. Eyes like fire in the night, bridges burning with their light. Now I want to spend the whole night through, and Honey, yes, I'd like to spend it all on you. Love, look what you've done to me. Never thought I'd fall again so easily. Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me. Leading me to feel this way. They might fade, and turn to stone. Let's get crazy all alone. Hold me closer than you'd ever dare, close your eyes, and I'll be there. After all, is said and done. After all, you are the one. Take me up your stairs and through the door. Take me where we don't care anymore. Love, look what you've done to me. Never thought I'd fall again so easily. Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me, would you. Leading me to feel this way. Love, look what you've done to me. Never thought I'd fall again so easily. Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me. Leading me to feel this way.	9
	Slow Dancing	Johnny Rivers				It's late at night, and we're all alone, with just the music on the radio. No one's coming, no one's gonna telephone. Just me and you and the lights down low, and we're slow dancing, swaying to the music. Slow dancing, just me and my girl. Slow dancing, swaying to the music. No one else in the whole wide world, just you, girl. And we just flow together when the lights are low. Shadows dancing all across the wall. The music's playing so soft and slow. The rest of the world so far away and small. When we're slow dancing, swaying to the music. Slow dancing, just me and my girl. Slow dancing, swaying to the music. No one else in the whole wide world. Hold me, oh, hold me, don't ever let me go, as we dance together in the dark. There's so much love in this heart of mine. You whisper to me "hold me tight". You're the one I thought I'd never find and now were. Slow dancing, swaying to the music. Slow dancing, just me and my girl. Slow dancing, swaying to the music. No one else in the whole wide world. Slow dancing, swaying to the music. Slow dancing, just me and my, my, my, my girl. Slow dancing, swaying to the music. No one else in the whole wide world. Whole wide world.	8
	Be Free With Me	Frank Moody				About to leave, already packing, come with me. I’m not really asking. We’ll get away to a place where we don’t know. About to see the world in action. What we can be, life with no distractions. We’ll get away, this is what we waited for. Take my hand we’ll make it somehow. We can’t miss out. I’m done living life with the lights out. Die with my own doubts. Be free with me. (Let’s go, let’s) Be free with me. Be free. Be free. Not looking back, eyes on the freeway. Bonnie and Clyde, a classic cliché. We’re on the run, this is what we’ve waited for. Take my hand we’ll make it somehow. We can’t miss out. I’m done living life with the lights out. Die with my own doubts. Be free. Be free with me. (Let’s go, let’s) Be free with me. Be free. Be free with me. (Let’s go, let’s) Be free with me. Be free.	10
	God Whispered Your Name	Keith Urban				I was so cold and lost, and nothing seemed to ring true. I couldn't bear the cross. For everything, I'd been through, and each day, I knew I needed change, but there was no way, no way. And then God whispered your name, and that's when everything changed. And love came out of the rain, and talk about being saved. Suddenly, I wanna live more than I ever did. I'm never gonna be the same when God whispered your name. I can see the sunshine for the first time in a while. Girl, it's like I've been baptized by the warmth of your smile, mmm. Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way. It's amazin', amazin' grace. When God whispered your name, that's when everything changed. Love came out of the rain. Talk about being saved. Well, suddenly, I wanna live more than I ever did. I'm never gonna be the same when God whispered your name. It's just what I needed to hear, baby. It couldn't have been more loud and clear. When God whispered your name, that's when everything changed. Love came out of the rain (Out of the rain), and talk about being saved. Oh, suddenly, I wanna live more than I ever did. I'm never gonna be the same when God whispered your name, oh yeah. (Hallelujah, Hallelujah) (Hallelujah) Ooh, Hallelujah, baby. Oh yeah, mmm (Hallelujah, Hallelujah) (Hallelujah) Ooh, yeah. I can see the sunlight shinin' through your pretty eyes, baby. Woo! Mmm (Hallelujah, Hallelujah) I like a man who leaves, time feels like hell (Hallelujah) Got my hands up high, I got my hands up to the sky (Hallelujah, Hallelujah) Ooh, I'm sayin' thank you (Hallelujah) (Hallelujah, Hallelujah) (Hallelujah)	7
	Here and Now	Luther Vandross				One look in your eyes and there I see just what you mean to me. Here in my heart I believe your love is all I'll ever need. Holdin' you close through the night, I need you, yeah. I look in your eyes and there I see what happiness really means. The love that we share makes life so sweet. Together we'll always be this pledge of love feels so right and, ooh, I need you. Here and now I promise to love faithfully. You're all I need, here and now. I vow to be one with thee, hey, your love is all I need. When I look in your eyes, there I'll see all that a love should really be and I need you more and more each day. Nothin' can take your love away more than I dare to dream, I need you. Here and now I promise to love faithfully. You're all I need, here and now. I vow to be one with thee, yeah. Your love is all I need. Ooh, and I'm starting now I believe, I believe I'm starting right here right now because I believe in your love. So I'm glad to take the vow.  Here and now, oh, I promise to love faithfully. You're all I need, here and now, yeah. I vow to be one with thee, yeah, your love is all I need.	9
	Better Together	Joe Jackson				There is no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard. No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart. Our dreams, and they are made out of real things like a shoe box of photographs with sepia-toned loving. Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart like, why are we here? and, where do we go? and, how come it's so hard? It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving. I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together. It's always better when we're together. Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together. Well, it's always better when we're together. Yeah, it's always better when we're together. And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight. But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings and brings new things. For tomorrow night you see that they'll be gone too. Too many things I have to do. But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene, I'd be under the impression. I was somewhere in between with only two: just me and you. Not so many things we got to do, or places we got to be. We'll sit beneath the mango tree now. Yeah, it's always better when we're together. We're somewhere in between together. Well, it's always better when we're together. Yeah, it's always better when we're together. I believe in memories. They look so, so pretty when I sleep. Hey now, and when I wake up, you look so pretty sleeping next to me. But there is not enough time, and there is no, no song I could sing. And there is no combination of words I could say. But I will still tell you one thing - we're better together.	7
	Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye by The Casino	The Casino				Kiss me each morning for a million years. Hold me each evening by your side. Tell me you'll love me for a million years, then if it don't work out. Then if it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye. Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss. Soften my dreams with your sighs. Tell me you'll love me for a million years, then if it don't work out. Then if it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye. If you must go, oh no, I won't grieve. If you wait a lifetime before you leave, then if you must go, I won't tell you, no. Just so, that we can say we tried. Tell me you'll love me for a million years, then if it don't work out. Then if it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye.	11
	I Won't Give Up	Jason Mraz				When I look into your eyes, it's like watching the night sky or a beautiful sunrise, well, there's so much they hold. And just like them old stars, I see that you've come so far to be right where you are. How old is your soul? Well, I won't give up on us even if the skies get rough. I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up. And when you're needing your space to do some navigating, I'll be here patiently waiting to see what you find. 'Cause even the stars they burn some even fall to the earth. We've got a lot to learn, God knows we're worth it. No, I won't give up. I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make. Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake. And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend for us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn, we had to learn how to bend without the world caving in. I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not and who I am. I won't give up on us even if the skies get rough. I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up, I'm still looking up. Well, I won't give up on us God knows I'm tough, he knows. We got a lot to learn God knows we're worth it. I won't give up on us even if the skies get rough. I'm giving you all my love I'm still looking up.	8
	Thinking Out Loud	Ed Sheeran				When your legs don't work like they used to before, and I can't sweep you off of your feet. Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And darling, I will be loving you 'til we're seventy. And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three. And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways, maybe just the touch of a hand. Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day, and I just wanna tell you I am. So honey, now, take me into your loving arms. Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars. Place your head on my beating heart. I'm thinking out loud maybe we found love right where we are. When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades, and the crowds don't remember my name. When my hands don't play the strings the same way I know, you will still love me the same. 'Cause honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen, and baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory. I'm thinking 'bout, how people fall in love in mysterious ways maybe it's all part of a plan. Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes. Hoping that you'll understand. That baby, now, take me into your loving arms. Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars. Place your head on my beating heart. Thinking out loud, maybe we found love right where we are. So baby, now, take me into your loving arms. Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars. Place your head on my beating heart. Thinking out loud, maybe we found love right where we are. Oh, baby, we found love right where we are, and we found love right where we are.	7

	I Want To Know What Love Is	Journey				I gotta take a little time. A little time to think things over. I better read between the lines, in case I need it when I'm older.

	Tenerife Sea	Ed Sheeran				You look so wonderful in your dress. I love your hair like that, the way it falls on the side of your neck down your shoulders and back, we are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much. You got that kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us. Should this be the last thing I see? I want you to know it's enough for me 'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need. I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love. You look so beautiful in this light.

	Future Days	Pearl Jam				If I ever were to lose you, I'd surely lose myself. Everything I have found here, I'm not found by myself. Try and sometimes you'll succeed, to make this man of me. All my stolen, missing parts I’ve no need for anymore. I believe, and I believe 'cause I can see, our future days, days of you and me. Back when I was feeling broken, I focused on a prayer. You came deep as any ocean. Did something out there hear? All the complexities and games, no one wins, but somehow they're still played. All the missing crooked hearts they may die, but in us, they live on. I believe, and I believe 'cause I can see, our future days, days of you and me. When hurricanes and cyclones raged, when wind turned dirt to dust. When floods—they came or tides they raised, ever closer became us. All the promises at sundown. I've meant them like the rest.All the demons used to come round. I'm grateful, now they've left. So persistent in my ways. Hey, angel, I am here to stay. No resistance, no alarms, please, this is just too good to be gone. I believe, and I believe 'cause I can see, our future days, days of you and me. You and me. Days of you and me.	8.5

One restless summer, we found love growing wild on the banks of the river on a well-beaten path. It's funny how those memories they last. Like strawberry wine, and seventeen. The hot July moon saw everything. My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet. The green on the vine, like strawberry wine. I still remember when thirty was old. My biggest fear was September when he had to go. A few cards and letters and one long-distance call. We drifted away like the leaves in the fall, but year after year, I come back to this place just to remember the taste of strawberry wine and seventeen. The hot July moon saw everything. My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet. The green on the vine, like strawberry wine. The fields have grown over now, years since they've seen a plow. There's nothing time hasn't touched.

My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet, and green on the vine, like strawberry wine. And seventeen, the hot July moon saw everything. My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet. The green on the vine, like strawberry wine. Strawberry wine. Strawberry wine.	7.5
	Wild Horses	Rolling Stone				Childhood living is easy to do. The things you wanted I bought them for you. Graceless lady you know who I am. You know I can't let you slide through my hands. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away. I watched you suffer a dull aching pain. Now you decided to show me the same. No sweeping exits or offstage lines could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away. I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie. I have my freedom, but I don't have much time. Faith has been broken. Tears must be cried. Let's do some living after we die. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday.	10
	Parallel Line	Keith Urban				You said, "I love you" to me, and I don't know what that means so I froze on my feet. People use it so carelessly, and I couldn't believe that you would dive in so deep.

Then you were right by my side. Put a soul in my body, and now it's time to close the space between the two of us. So come on, and take a little bit of my heart tonight. No, I literally don't mind.

It's always on a night like tonight, I thank God you can read my mind, 'cause when you look at me with those eyes, I'm speechless. Starin' at you standin' there in that dress, what it's doin' to me ain't a secret. 'Cause watching you is all that I can do, and I'm speechless. You already know that you're my weakness. After all this time, I'm just as nervous. Every time you walk into the room, I'm speechless. It started when you said hello, just did something to me.

	Til There Was You	The Beatles				There were bells on a hill, but I never heard them ringing. No, I never heard them at all. Til there was you. There were birds in the sky, but I never saw them winging. No, I never saw them at all. Til there was you. Then there was music and wonderful roses. They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew. There was love all around, but I never heard it singing. No, I never heard it at all. Til there was you.

	Bat Out Of Hell	Meatloaf				The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling, way down in the valley tonight. There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye, and a blade shining, oh, so bright. There's evil in the air, and there's thunder in sky, and a killer's on the bloodshot streets. Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising. Oh, I swear, I saw a young boy down in the gutter. He was starting to foam in the heat. Oh, baby, you're the only thing in this whole world, that's pure and good, and right. And wherever you are, and wherever you go, there's always gonna be some light. But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now before the final crack of dawn. So we gotta make the most of our one night together. When it's over you know, we'll both be so alone. Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes, when the night is over. Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone-gone-gone. Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes. But when the day is done, and the sun goes down, and the moonlight's shining through, then like a sinner before the gates of heaven, I'll come crawling on back to you. I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram on a silver-black phantom bike. When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry, and we're all about to see the light. Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole, and everything is stunted and lost. And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls, and nothing's ever worth the cost. And I know that I'm damned if I never get out, and maybe I'm damned if I do, but with every other beat I've got left in my heart, you know I'd rather be damned with you. Well, if I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned, dancing through the night with you. Well, if I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned. Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned. Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned. Dancing through the night. Dancing through the night. Dancing through the night with you. Oh, baby, you're the only thing in this whole world, that's pure and good and right. And wherever you are and wherever you go, there's always gonna be some light. But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now, before the final crack of dawn. So we gotta make the most of our one night together. When it's over you know we'll both be so alone. Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes, when the night is over. Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone gone gone. Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes, but when the day is done and the sun goes down, and the moonlight's shining through, then like a sinner before the gates of heaven. I'll come crawling on back to you. Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven, I'll come crawling on back to you. I can see myself tearing up the road. Faster than any other boy has ever gone, and my skin is raw but my soul is ripe. No one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape. But I can't stop thinking of you, and I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late. And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late. Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun. Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike, and I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell. And the last thing I see is my heart till beating, breaking out of my body and flying away, like a bat out of hell. Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun. Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike, and I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell. And the last thing I see is my heart still beating, still beating, breaking out of my body and flying away, like a bat out of hell. Like a bat out of hell. Like a bat out of hell. Oh, like a bat out of hell! Like a bat out of hell! Like a bat out of hell!	4.5

That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world. You better respect your Mama, respect the hell out of her 'cause that's how you talk to a woman, and that's how you speak to a girl. She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind. She just wanna feel that you're real, that she's near to the man that's inside.

	When You Say Nothing At All	Alison Krauss				It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart, without saying a word you can light up the dark. Try as I may, I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall. You say it best when you say nothing at all. All day long I can hear people talking out loud, but when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd. Old Mr. Webster could never define, what's being said between your heart and mine. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall. You say it best when you say nothing at all. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall. You say it best when you say nothing at all.	9
	This Night	Billy Joel				Didn't I say, I wasn't ready for a romance. Didn't we promise, we would only be friends. And so we danced though it was only a slow dance. I started breaking my promises, right there, and then. Didn't I swear, there would be no complications. Didn't you want someone who's seen it all before. Now that you're here, it's not the same situation. Suddenly, I don't remember the rules anymore. This night is mine. It's only you and I. Tomorrow is a long time away. This night can last forever. I've been around, someone like me should know better. Falling in love would be the worst thing I could do. Didn't I say, I needed time to forget her. Aren't you running from someone who's not over you? How many nights have I been lonely without you. I tell myself how much I really don't care. How many nights have I been thinking about you, wanting to hold you, but knowing you would not be there. This night you're mine. It's only you and I. I'll tell you to forget yesterday. This night we are together. This night is mine. It's only you and I. Tomorrow is such a long time away. This night can last forever. Tomorrow is such a long time away. This night can last forever.	8.5
	First Day Of My Life	Bright Eyes				This is the first day of my life swear I was born right in the doorway. I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed. They're spreading blankets on the beach. Yours is the first face that I saw. I think I was blind before I met you. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I've been, but I know where I want to go. And so I thought I'd let you know that these things take forever, I especially am slow. But I realize that I need you and I wondered if I could come home. Remember the time you drove all night just to meet me in the morning. And I thought it was strange, you said, everything changed. You felt as if you'd just woke up. And you said, This is the first day of my life. I'm glad I didn't die before I met you, but now I don't care. I could go anywhere with you, and I'd probably be happy. So if you wanna be with me. With these things, there's no telling we just have to wait and see. But I'd rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery. Besides maybe this time it's different, I mean I really think you like me.	9
	A Thousand Years	Christina Perri				Heart beats fast, colors, and promises. How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?

Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you, for a thousand years, I'll love you for a thousand more. Time stands still. Beauty in all she is. I will be brave.

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru. In llama land, there's a one-man band, and he'll toot his flute for you. Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue. Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied. We'll just glide, starry-eyed. Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near. You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together.

	The One	Elton John				I saw you dancing out the ocean, running fast along the sand. A spirit born of earth, and water, fire flying from your hands. In the instant that you love someone, in the second that the hammer hits reality runs up your spine, and the pieces finally fit. And all I ever needed was the one like freedom fields where wild horses run. When stars collide like you and I, no shadows block the sun. You're all I've ever needed, baby, you're the one. There are caravans we follow, drunken nights in dark hotels. When chances breathe between the silence, where sex and love no longer gel. For each man in his time is Cain, until he walks along the beach, and sees his future in the water. A long lost heart within his reach.	10
	Amazed	Lonestar				Every time our eyes meet, this feeling inside me is almost more than I can take. Baby, when you touch me, I can feel how much you love me, and it just blows me away.

I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side forever and ever. Every little thing that you do, baby, I'm amazed by you. The smell of your skin, the taste of your kiss, the way you whisper in the dark. Your hair all around me, baby, you surround me, you touch every place in my heart. Oh, it feels like the first time, every time. I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes. I don't know how you do what you do. I'm so in love with you. It just keeps getting better.

	H.O.L.Y	Florida Georgia Line				When the sun had left and the winter came, and the sky fall could only bring the rain. I sat in darkness, all broken hearted. I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone. I never meant to cry, started losing hope. But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me.

	Thank You For Loving Me	Bon Jovi				It's hard for me to say the things, I wanna say sometimes. There's no one here but you and me, and that broken old street light. Lock the doors, leave the world outside. All I've got to give to you are these five words tonight. Thank you for loving me for being my eyes when I couldn't see. For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe. Thank you for loving me, thank you for loving me. I never knew I had a dream. Until that dream was you. When I look into your eyes, the sky's a different blue. Cross my heart, I wear no disguise. If I tried, you'd make-believe, that you believed my lies. Thank you for loving me for being my eyes when I couldn't see. For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe. Thank you for loving me. You pick me up when I fall down. You ring the bell before they count me out. If I was drowning you would part the sea and risk your own life to rescue me. Lock the doors, leave the world outside.

Oh, for loving me.	8

	In My Life	The Beatles				There are places I'll remember all my life though some have changed, some forever not for better, some have gone and some remain. All these places had their moments with lovers and friends. I still can recall. Some are dead, and some are living. In my life, I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers there is no one compares with you, and these memories lose their meaning when I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life, I love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life, I love you more. In my life, I love you more.	10

	It Might Be You	Stephen Bishop				Time I've been passing time watching trains go by all of my life, lying on the sand watching sea birds fly. Wishing there would be someone waiting home for me. Something's telling me it might be you, it's telling me it might be you, all of my life. Looking back as lovers go walking past all of my life, wondering how they met and what makes it last. If I found the place, would I recognize the face? Something's telling me it might be you, yeah, it's telling me it might be you. So many quiet walks to take, so many dreams to make and with so much love to make. I think we're gonna meet sometime, maybe all we need is time, and it's telling me it might be you, all of my life.

This love, that I feel for you, always will be. You're not just time that I'm killing, I'm no longer one of those guys. As sure as I live this love that I give is gonna be yours until the day that I die – oh, baby. I'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever, amen.

	Time In A Bottle	Jim Croce				If I could save time in a bottle. The first thing that I'd like to do is to save every day till eternity passes away, just to spend them with you. If I could make days last forever. If words could make wishes come true I'd save every day like a treasure and then, again, I would spend them with you. But there never seems to be enough time to do the things you want to do, once you find them. I've looked around enough to know that you're the one I want to go through time with. If I had a box, just for wishes and dreams that had never come true. The box would be empty except for the memory of how they were answered by you. But there never seems to be enough time to do the things you want to do, once you find them. I've looked around enough to know that you're the one I want to go through time with.	10
	Hold On Magnolia	Ohia				Hold on Magnolia to that great highmoon moon. No one has to be that strong, but if you're stubborn like me, I know what you're trying to be. Hold on Magnolia, I hear that station bell ring. You might be holding the last light I see before the dark finally gets a hold of me. Hold on Magnolia, I know what a true friend you've been. In my life, I have had my doubts, but tonight I think I've worked it out with all of them. Hold on Magnolia, to the thunder and the rain, to the lighting that has just signed my name to the bottom line. Hold on Magnolia, to that great highway moon. No one has to be that strong, but if you're stubborn like me, I know what you're trying to be. Hold on Magnolia, I hear that lonesome whistle whine. Hold on Magnolia, I think it's almost time. Hold on Magnolia, I think it's almost time. It's almost time.	10
	Never Stop Loving You	Steelheart				I remember the days when our lives were so complete. We had each other, love was all we would need, but now you have changed since the first day that we met. You found a new lover, it's me you want to forget. You tried to tell me our love was in vain. I'm a victim of your love babe, and you're to blame. You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through 'cause I'll be there forever holdin', you can't stop me lovin' you. Now that you're gone, life is empty and cold. Oh, how I miss having you to hold. My nights are sleepless, I'll never be the same. Living without you I'm going insane, and as I sit here wipin' tears from my eyes.

You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through 'cause I'll be there forever holdin', you can't stop me lovin' you.	8

	You're In My Heart	Rod Stewart				I didn't know what day it was when you walked into the room. I said hello unnoticed, you said goodbye too soon. Breezing through the clientele, spinning yarns that were so lyrical. I really must confess right here. The attraction was purely physical. I took all those habits of yours. That, in the beginning, were hard to accept. Your fashion sense, beardsly prints, I put down to experience. The big bosomed lady with the dutch accent who tried to change my point of view. Her ad-lib lines were well-rehearsed, but my heart cried out for you. You're in my heart. You're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover. You're my best friend. You're in my soul. My love for you is immeasurable. My respect for you immense. You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness. You're beauty and elegance. You're a rhapsody, a comedy. You're a symphony and a play. You're every love song ever written, but honey, what do you see in me? You're in my heart.  You're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover. You're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're an essay in glamor. Please pardon the grammar, but you're every schoolboy's dream. You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided. You're the best team I've ever seen, and there have been many affairs. Many times I've thought to leave, but I bite my lip and turn around 'cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found. You're in my heart. You're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover. You're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're in my heart. You're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover. You're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're in my heart. You're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover.

	Prayed For You	Matt Stell				I've never been one to ask for help. If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself. I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday, quote you the scripture kind. I'm far from a preacher, but I'm a believer. 'Cause every single day before I knew your name, I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you. Every heartbreak, trail when all hope fell on the highway to hell, I prayed for you. I kept my faith like that old King James said I'm supposed to. It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom, I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you. For someone to love me like you do, graceful eyes to see me through. A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me, a touch that kills me too. Baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it. 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name, I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you. Every heartbreak, trail when all hope fell on the highway to hell, I prayed for you.

	I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing	Aerosmith				I could stay awake just to hear you breathing. Watch you smile while you are sleeping, while you're far away and dreaming.

April 2	Straight From The Heart	Bryan Adams				I could start dreamin', but it never ends as long as you're gone we may as well pretend. I've been dreamin' straight from the heart. You say it's easy, but who's to say. That we'd be able to keep it this way, but it's easier comin' straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make another start. You know I'll never go as long as I know it's comin' straight from the heart. I'll see you on the street some other time, and all our words would just fall out of line while we're dreamin' straight from the heart. Give it to me straight from the heart. Tell me we can make one more start. You know I'll never go as long as I know it's coming straight from the heart. Don't ever leave me, darling. Straight from the heart.

	Best Part Of Me	Ed Sheeran				My lungs are black. My heart is pure. My hands are scarred from nights before, and my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places. I am a little insecure. My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue. I bite my nails and tell the truth. I go from thin to overweight, day to day it fluctuates. My skin is inked but faded too, but she loves me, she loves me. Why the hell she love me? When she could have anyone else? Oh, you love me, you love me. Why the hell do you love me? 'Cause I don't even love myself. Baby, the best part of me is you. Lately, everything's making sense too. Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you. I overthink and still forgive. I lose my phone and place my bets, and I never catch the train on time. Always thirty minutes behind. Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet, but you love me, you love me. Why the hell you love me so? When you could have anyone else? Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me, and I bet he never lets me go, and shows me, how to love myself. 'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, whoa.

She's as sweet as tupelo honey. She's an angel of the first degree. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. Just like honey from the bee. You can't stop us on the road to freedom. You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see. Men with insight, men in granite. Knights in armor bent on chivalry. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. She's an angel of the first degree. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. Just like honey from the bee. You can't stop us on the road to freedom. You can't stop us 'cause our eyes can see. Men with insight, men in granite. Knights in armor intent on chivalry. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. She's an angel of the first degree. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. Just like honey from the bee. You know she's alright. You know she's alright with me. She's alright, she's alright (she's an angel) You can take all the tea in China. Put it in a big brown bag for me. Sail it right around the seven oceans. Drop it smack dab in the middle of the deep blue sea because she's as sweet as tupelo honey. She's an angel of the first degree. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. Just like honey from the bee. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. She's an angel of the first degree. She's as sweet as tupelo honey. Just like the honey, baby, from the bee. She's my baby, you know she's alright.	7.5
April 3	Fools Rush In	Frank Sinatra				Romance is a game for fools, I used to say. A game I thought I'd never play. "Romance is a game for fools", I said and grinned. Then you passed by and here am I throwing caution through the wind. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread, and so I come to you, my love. My heart above my head, though I see the danger there. If there's a chance for me, then I don't care. Fools rush in where wise men never go, but wise men never fall in love. So how are they to know? When we met, I felt my life begin. So open up your heart, and let this fool rush in.	13

Someone like you makes it all worth while. Someone like you keeps me satisfied. Someone exactly like you. I've been travelin' a hard road baby, lookin' for someone exactly like you.

I stayed up all night, so I could get this thing right, and I don't think there's anything missing cause a person like you, made it easy to do. I've waited for so long, to sing to you this song cause your eyes are the windows to heaven. Your smile could heal a million souls. Your love completes my existence.

But you stay here right beside me, watch as the storm goes through. And I need you. God gave me you for the ups and downs. God gave me you for the days of doubt. For when I think I've lost my way, there are no words here left to say, it's true - God gave me you. There's more here than what we’re seeing - a divine conspiracy. That you, an angel lovely could somehow fall for me. You'll always be love's great martyr, I'll be the flattered fool. And I need you. God gave me you for the ups and downs. God gave me you for the days of doubt. For when I think I've lost my way, there are no words here left to say, it's true - God gave me you. On my own, I'm only half of what I could be.

	Misty	Johnny Mathis				Look at me. I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree, and I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud. I can't understand, I get misty, just holding your hand. Walk my way, and a thousand violins begin to play, or it might be the sound of your hello. That music I hear, I get misty the moment you're near. You can say that you're leading me on, but it's just what I want you to do. Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost, that's why I'm following you. On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone. Never knowing my right foot from my left. My hat from my glove, I'm too misty and too much in love. Look at me.	12
	Kiss From A Rose	Seal				There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea. You became the light on the dark side of me. Love remained a drug, that's the high and not the pill, but did you know that when it snows my eyes become large, and the light that you shine can be seen? Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey. Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels. Yeah, now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey. There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say. You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny. Won't you tell me is that healthy baby? But did you know that when it snows, my eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen? Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey. Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels. Yeah, now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey. I've been kissed by a rose on the grey.

	Let Me Be Your Man	Hootie & The Blowfish				I've been waiting for you. I wish you could too. Had you too long to lay back now. First time you caught my eye, I knew I want to spend my life. Making you feel like you should. I'm not trying to make you do, nothing you don't want to, but I said I love you. My love depends on you. It grow, it flows, it goes by you. Won't you let me be your man? So if you'd only tell me (if you'd only tell me) Tell me that you love me (tell me that you love me) I'll be the luckiest man alive. I just keep on waiting, anticipating 'til the day you say you're mine. I'm not trying to make you do, nothing you don't want to, but I said I love you. My love depends on you. It grow, it flows, it goes by you. Won't you let me be your man? Won't you let me be your man? Let me be your man. Won't you let me be your man?	10
	I Love You Just The Way You Are	Billy Joel				Don't go changing to try and please me. You never let me down before. Don't imagine you're too familiar, and I don't see you anymore. I would not leave you in times of trouble. We never could have come this far. I took the good times. I'll take the bad times. I'll take you just the way you are. Don't go trying some new fashion. Don't change the color of your hair. You always have my unspoken passion although I might not seem to care. I don't want clever conversation. I never want to work that hard. I just want someone that I can talk to. I want you just the way you are. I need to know that you will always be the same old someone that I knew. What will it take till you believe in me the way that I believe in you. I said I love you, and that's forever, and this I promise from the heart. I could not love you any better. I love you just the way you are. I don't want clever conversation. I never want to work that hard. I just want someone that I can talk to. I want you just the way you are.	9

	Stuck With You	Huey Lewis & The New Lyrics				We've had some fun, and yes, we've had our ups and downs. Been down that rocky road, but here we are, still around. We thought about someone else, but neither one took the bait. We thought about breaking up, but now we know it's much too late. We are bound by all the rest, like the same phone number, all the same friends, and the same address. Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you. Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 'cause I can see, (I can see) that you're happy to be stuck with me. We've had our doubts, we never took them seriously, and we've had our ins and outs, but that's the way it's supposed to be. We thought about giving up, but we could never stay away. Thought about breaking up, but now we know it's much too late, and it's no great mystery if we change our minds. Eventually, it's back to you and me. Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you. Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 'cause I can see, (I can see) that you're happy to be stuck with me. We are bound by all the rest, like the same phone number, all the same friends, and the same address. Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you. Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 'cause I can see, (I can see) that you're happy to be stuck with me (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you. I'm happy to be stuck with you. Happy to be stuck with you.	7.5
	What A Wonderful World	Louis Armstrong				I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and you. And I think to myself, what a wonderful world. I see skies of blue and clouds of white. The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night. And I think to myself, what a wonderful world. The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky, are also on the faces of people going by. I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?" They're really saying, "I love you." I hear babies cry. I watch them grow. They'll learn much more than I'll never know. And I think to myself, what a wonderful world. Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world. Oh, yeah.	11
	Are You Gonna Kiss Me Or Not	Thompson Square				We were sittin' up there on your Momma's roof, talkin' 'bout everything under the moon with the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume. All I could think about was my next move. Oh, but you were so shy, so was I. Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe when you smiled and said to me, "Are you gonna kiss me or not? Are we gonna do this or what? I think you know I like you a lot, but you're 'bout to miss your shot. Are you gonna kiss me or not?" It was the best dang kiss that I ever had, except for that long one after that. And I knew if I wanted this thing to last, sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand. So, I took a chance, bought a wedding band, and I got down on one knee. And you smiled and said to me, "Are you gonna kiss me or not? Are we gonna do this or what? I think you know I love you a lot. I think we've got a real good shot. Are you gonna kiss me or not?" So, we planned it all out for the middle of June. From the wedding cake to the honeymoon. And your Momma cried when you walked down the aisle. When the Preacher man said, "Say I do." I did, and you did, too. Then I lifted that veil. And saw your pretty smile and I said, "Are you gonna kiss me or not? Are we gonna do this or what? Look at all the love that we got, it ain't never gonna stop. Are you gonna kiss me or not?" Yeah, baby, I love you a lot. I really think we've got a shot. Are you gonna kiss me or not?	7.5
	In Case You Didn’t Know	Brett Young				I can't count the times I almost said what's on my mind, but I didn't. Just the other day I wrote down all the things I'd say, but I couldn't. I just couldn't. Baby, I know that you've been wondering. Mmm, so here goes nothing. In case you didn't know, baby, I'm crazy 'bout you. And I would be lying if I said that I could live this life without you. Even though I don't tell you all the time, you had my heart a long, long time ago. In case you didn't know, the way you look tonight, that second glass of wine, that did it, mmm. There was something about that kiss, girl it did me in. Got me thinking. I'm thinking one of the things that I've been feeling mmm, it's time you here 'em. In case you didn't know, baby, I'm crazy 'bout you. And I would be lying if I said that I could live this life without you. Even though I don't tell you all the time, you had my heart a long, long time ago. In case you didn't know, you've got all of me. I belong to you. Yeah, you're my everything. In case you didn't know, I'm crazy 'bout you. I would be lying if I said that I could live this life without you. Even though I don't tell you all the time, you had my heart a long, long time ago. Mmm, in case you didn't know. No, no in case you didn't know.	8
	Beautiful In My Eyes	Joshua Kadison				You're my peace of mind, in this crazy world. You're everything I've tried to find your love is a pearl. You're my Mona Lisa, you're my rainbow skies, and my only prayer is that you realize, you'll always be beautiful, in my eyes. The world will turn, and the seasons will change. And all the lessons we will learn will be beautiful and strange. We'll have our fill of tears, our share of sighs. My only prayer is that you realize. You'll always be beautiful in my eyes. You will always be beautiful in my eyes. And the passing years will show that you will always grow ever more beautiful in my eyes. And there are lines upon my face from a lifetime of smiles. But when the time comes to embrace for one long last while. We can laugh about it, how time really flies. We won't say goodbye, 'cause true love never dies. You'll always be beautiful in my eyes. You will always be beautiful in my eyes. And the passing years will show that you will always grow ever more beautiful in my eyes. The passing years will show that you will always grow ever more beautiful in my eyes.	9
	By Your Side	Sade				You think I'd leave your side, baby? You know me better than that. You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees? I wouldn't do that. I'll tell you, you're right when you want and if only you could see into me. Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there, hold you tight to me. When you're on the outside, baby, and you can't get in, I will show you. You're so much better than you know. When you're lost, and you're alone. And you can't get back again, I will find you, darling, and I will bring you home. And if you want to cry, I am here to dry your eyes, and in no time you'll be fine. You think I'd leave your side, baby? You know me better than that. You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees? I wouldn't do that. I'll tell you you're right when you want and if only you could see into me. Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there, hold you tight to me. Oh, when you're low, I'll be there by your side, baby. Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there, hold you tight to me. Oh, when you're low, I'll be there by your side, baby.	9
	Faithfully	Journey				Highway run, into the midnight sun. Wheels go round, and round, you're on my mind. Restless hearts sleep alone tonight. Sendin' all my love along the wire. They say that the road ain't no place to start a family. Right down the line, it's been you and me. And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be. Oh, girl, you stand by me.

I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl. Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been. We've come so far since that day, and I thought I loved you then. And I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you, you were so surprised. There were people around, but I didn't care.

Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been. We've come so far since that day. And I thought, I loved you then. And I can just see you, with a baby on the way. And I can just see you, when your hair is turning gray. What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more, but I've said that before. And now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world. I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl. We'll look back someday, at this moment that we're in. And I'll look at you and say. And I thought I loved you then, and I thought I loved you then.	8

	Broken Together	Casting Crowns				What do you think about when you look at me. I know we're not the fairytale you dreamed we'd be. You wore the veil, you walked the aisle, you took my hand and we dove into a mystery. How I wish we could go back to simpler times, before all our scars and all our secrets were in the light. Now on this hallowed ground, we've drawn the battle lines, will we make it through the night? It's gonna take much more than promises this time, only God can change our minds. Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete. Could we just be broken together? If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine. Could healing still be spoken and save us? The only way we'll last forever is broken together. How it must have been so lonely by my side. We were building kingdoms and chasing dreams and left love behind. I'm praying God will help our broken hearts align and we won't give up the fight. It's gonna take much more than promises this time, only God can change our minds. Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete. Could we just be broken together? If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine. Could healing still be spoken and save us? The only way we'll last forever is broken together. Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete. Could we just be broken together? If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine.

April 8	Eyes For Nobody	Chris Janson				For a guy like me, it takes a while to find something like I found in your smile. When we're about to start standing here today, I'll be by your side no matter what we face, and there's a road I wanna take you down where we can lay roots in the ground. Solid as a rock, my word is true. Girl, I got eyes for nobody but you. You can blame that place where I first saw you. Blame how I was raised on the things I do.

	Whenever You Remember	Carrie Underwood				When you look back on times we had, I hope you smile and know that through the good and through the bad, I was on your side when nobody could hold us down. We claimed the brightest star, and we, we came so far, and no, they won't forget. Whenever you remember times gone by, remember how we held our heads so high. When all this world was there for us, and we believed that we could touch the sky. Whenever you remember, I'll be there. Remember how we reached that dream together whenever you remember. When you think back on all we've done, I hope you're proud when you look back and see how far we've come. It was our time to shine, and nobody could hold us down.

April 9	Come Away With Me	Norah Jones				Come away with me in the night. Come away with me, and I will write you a song. Come away with me on a bus - come away where they can't tempt us with their lies. And I want to walk with you on a cloudy day. In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high, so won't you try to come. Come away with me, and we'll kiss on a mountaintop. Come away with me, and I'll never stop loving you. And I want to wake up with the rain falling on a tin roof while I'm safe there in your arms. So all I ask is for you to come away with me in the night. Come away with me.	13
	Ave Maria	Celine Dion				Ave Maria! Maiden mild! Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer. For thou canst hear amid the wild. 'Tis thou, 'tis thou canst save amid, despair. We slumber safely 'til the morrow.

Ave, ave dominus. Dominus tecum. The murky cavern's air so heavy. Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled. Oh, maiden, hear a maiden pleadin'. Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child. Ave Maria! Ave Maria!	16
	Falling Slowly	Glen Handsard & Marketa Irglova				I don't know you, but I want you. All the more for that. Words fall through me and always fool me, and I can't react, and games that never amount to more than they're meant. Will play themselves out. Take this sinking boat and point it home. We've still got time. Raise your hopeful voice. You have a choice. You'll make it now. Falling slowly, eyes that know me, and I can't go back. Moods that take me and erase me, and I'm painted black. You have suffered enough and warred with yourself. It's time that you won. Take this sinking boat and point it home. We've still got time. Raise your hopeful voice. You have a choice. You've made it now. Falling slowly, sing your melody. I'll sing along.	11
	You Make It Look So Easy	Eric Church				I got a hard head, I get that from my dad, and I can overreact maybe just a tad. I put up walls to show the world I'm tough. When I don't get my way, I get difficult, but when it comes to lovin' me, baby, you make it look so easy. You're my refuge from the road. A safe place to go when I'm out here livin' on this ledge, and when I'm circlin' the drain. You keep my crazy sane and quiet all the voices in my head. I'm probably wrong more than I say, and I'd point that out if you were that way. Yeah, I'm hard to love and even harder to live with, and I know there's days when you just want to up and quit, but when it comes to lovin' me, baby, you make it look so easy. You're my compass when I'm lost. My anchor when I get tossed, and the right way when all I can do is wrong. Sometimes, I drink 'til I fall down, but your arms save me from the ground and hold me 'til all the hurt is gone. I got a hard head, I was born that way, and that makes me wrong more than I say, but I thank God you got a hard head too. I guess he must have known you'd need that to get us through 'cause when it comes to lovin' me, baby, you make it look so easy. Yeah, baby, you make it look so easy.	8
	Timing Is Everything	Trace Adkins				When the stars line up, and you catch a good break, people think you're lucky, but you'll know its grace. It can happen so fast or a moment late. Timing is everything. Know I've had close calls when it could've been me. I was young when I learned just how fragile life could be. I lost friends of mine. I guess it wasn't my time. Timing is everything. I could've been a child that god took home. I would've been one more unfinished song. When it seems a rhyme hard to find, that's when one comes along just in time. Well, I remember that day when our eyes first met. You ran into the building to get out of the rain 'cause you were soaking wet, and as I held the door, you wanted to know my name. Timing is everything. I could've been another minute late. You never would've crossed my path that day. When it seems true love is hard to find, that's when love comes along just in time. You can call it fate or destiny. Sometimes, it's real it seems like it's a mystery. You can be hurt by love or healed by the same. Timing is everything, and it can happen so fast or a little bit late. Timing is everything.	9

April 12	I Want To Be That Song	Brett Eldredge				The radio and a sundress making my world all a mess. Back corner of a cornfield, bottle tops, and the truth spilled. Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin' you slippin' off your shoes while the dashboard speakers sing every word of "Night Moves." I wanna be that song that gets you high, makes you dance, makes you fall. That melody rewinds years once disappear, makes time stall. Wanna be those words that fill you up. Pull your windows down and keeps you young. Makes you believe you're right where you belong. I wanna be that song, I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song. Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna. I wanna stand with you in the third-row window booth at a bar, back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart (pourin' out your heart). When the bleachers are crowded. When you're sittin' all alone. When the rain is pourin', and you need something to take you home. Let me be that song that gets you high, makes you dance, makes you fall. That melody rewinds years once disappear, makes time stall. Wanna be those words that fill you up. Pull your windows down and keeps you young. Makes you believe you're right where you belong. I wanna be that song, I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song. Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna. When you're searching the horizon (searching the horizon). When your eyes look back.

	The Right Left Hand	George Jones				I've cried a million tears down through the years searching for that special one. And the vows I took before were all forevermore, but no matter how I tried, they came undone. Then the good Lord finally gave me the true love of a lady. Someone who believes in me, and she lets me know each day that love is here to stay. I finally found someone who'll never leave.

I put a golden band on the right-left hand this time. I'll never have to reach for the love that my heart needs. She'll be close enough to touch and when the nights are long and cold. She'll be there to hold all dressed up for one more night of love. I put a golden band on the right-left hand this time, and the right-left hand put a golden band on mine. When our hair is snowy white time will prove I'm right. I put a golden band on the right-left hand this time. I put a golden band on the right-left hand this time.	9

And when I hold you in my arms, my love won't do you no harm. And I feel nice, like sugar and spice. I feel nice, like sugar and spice. So nice, so nice I got you. Wow, I feel good I knew that I would, now. I feel, good I knew that I would. So good, so good I got you. So good, so good I got you. So good, so good I got you.	10
	(Kissed You) Good Night	Gloriana				I dropped you off just a little after midnight. Sat in my car till you turned off your porch light. I should have kissed you. I should have pushed you up against the wall. I should have kissed you just like I wasn’t scared at all. I turned off the car ran through the yard back to your front door. Before I could knock, you turned the lock and met me on the front porch. And I kissed you good night. And now that I’ve kissed you, it’s a good night. Good night, baby, good night. You couldn’t see me watching through the window, wondering what went wrong, praying that you wouldn’t go. You should have kissed me. You should have pushed me up against the wall. You should have kissed me. I was right on the edge and ready to fall. So I turned off the car ran through the yard back to your front door. Before I could knock, you turned the lock and met me on the front porch. And I kissed you good night. And now that I’ve kissed you, it’s a good night. Good night, baby, good night. I turned off the car ran through the yard back to your front door. Half scared to death can’t catch my breath. Aren’t these the moments we live for? And I kissed you good night. And now that I’ve kissed you, it’s a good night. Good night, baby, goodnight. It’s a good night, good night, baby, good night. It’s a good night, good night, baby, good night. It’s a good night, good night, baby, good night.	7.5
	Now and Forever	Kenny Rogers				Here we stand tracing the moments in our lives, hand in hand facing the future of our lives. No one has ever been closer. I feel your heartbeat moving with mine. Oh, love me now and forever. Tell me that you will never leave me. Now and forever stay and love me. Face to face, I see my hope for tomorrow. Place to place, lovely to wait for me to follow. No one could ever be nearer. Can't think of anyone else that I want to love me now and forever. Tell me that you will never leave me. Now and forever stay and love me. With every measure of time, there's a thought of you. And knowing I'm all you want 'cause we make it through.	12
	Always	Bon Jovi				This Romeo is bleeding, but you can't see his blood. It's nothing, but some feelings, that this old dog kicked up. It's been raining since you left me, now I'm drowning in the flood. You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up. Now I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be. Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just me. And I will love you, baby, always. And I'll be there forever and a day, always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind and I'll love you, always. Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life. Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry. One that made you have to say goodbye. What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair, to touch your lips, to hold you near. When you say your prayers, try to understand I've made mistakes, I'm just a man. When he holds you close when he pulls you near when he says the words you've been needing to hear. I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine, to say to you till the end of time. Yeah, I will love you, baby, always. And I'll be there forever and a day, always. If you told me to cry for you, I could. If you told me to die for you, I would. Take a look at my face, there's no price I won't pay, to say these words to you. Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice, but baby, if you give me just one more try. We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives. We'll find a place where the sun still shines. And I will love you, baby, always. And I'll be there forever and a day, always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind and I'll love you, always.	7
	What If I Said	Steve Wariner				We've been friends for a long, long time. You tell me your secrets, and I tell you mine. She's left you all alone, and you feel like no one cares, but I have never failed you, I've always been there. You tell your story, it sounds a bit like mine, it's the same old situation it happens every time. Can't we see? Oh, maybe you and me is what's meant to be? Or do we disagree? What if I told you (what if I said) that I loved you? How would you feel? What would you think? What would we do? Do we dare cross that line between your heart and mine? Or would I lose a friend? Or find a love that would never end? What if I said. She doesn't love you. Oh, it's plain to see. I can read between the lines of what you're telling me. And he doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held. How long can I go on keeping these feelings to myself? What if I told you (what if I said) that I loved you? How would you feel? What would you think? What would we do? Do we dare cross that line between your heart and mine? Or would I lose a friend? Or find a love that would never end? What if I said. Oh, we've both had our share of loneliness. So, who's to say we can't have a many happiness. And if I found that in you, it would make my dreams come true. Or would you walk away? Hear what I have to say. What if I told you (what if I said) that I loved you? How would you feel? What would you think? What would we do? Do we dare cross that line between your heart and mine? I've always wondered from that day that we met. What if I said. What if I said. Oh, what if I said.	7
	You Save Me	Kenny Chesney				Every now and then I get a little lost. My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed. Every now and then, I'm right up on the edge, dangling my toes out over the ledge. I just thank God you're here. 'Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun. 'Cause when I'm a firecracker coming undone, or when I'm a fugitive ready to run all wild-eyed and crazy. No matter where my reckless soul takes me, baby, you save me. It's hard loving' a man that's got a gypsy soul. I don't know how you do it. I'm not sure how you know. The perfect thing to say to save me from myself. You're the angel that believes in me like nobody else. And I thank God you do. 'Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun. When I'm a firecracker coming undone. When I'm a fugitive ready to run all wild-eyed and crazy. No matter where my reckless soul takes me, baby, you save me. I know, I don't tell you nearly enough that I couldn't live one day without your love. When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves, up on a high wire that's ready to break. When I've had just about all I can take, baby you, baby you, save me. When I'm a bullet shot out of a gun. When I'm a firecracker coming undone. When I'm a fugitive ready to run all wild-eyed and crazy. No matter where my reckless soul takes me, baby, you save me.	8
	For Evigt	Volbeat				Memory, your lamp light is burning holes. Recover the damage bring it all home. Follow the bliss just like a summer song please stay there forever. I'll try to remember, come home. Memory, you gave me another note. A voice that is endless brings it all home. Oh, what it is feels like a summer song. I'll stay here forever her face, I remember. For evigt, måske for evigt. Skal vi sammen, samme vej? Og når i morgen får øjne, og natten hviler sig. Skal vi for evigt måske samme vej? Happiness, I'm sorry you've been on hold. The doors will be open bring it all home. 'Cause what it is feels like a summer song. I'll stay here forever, now that I remember. For evigt, måske for evigt. Skal vi sammen, samme vej? Og når i morgen får øjne, og natten hviler sig. Skal vi for evigt måske samme vej? For all these symbols, don't open our eyes. We'll close them instead leave the messenger behind, but one day we will know. For evigt, måske for evigt. Skal vi sammen, samme vej? Og når i morgen får øjne, og natten hviler sig. Skal vi for evigt, måske for evigt. For evigt, måske for evigt. Skal vi sammen, samme vej? Og når i morgen får øjne, og natten hviler sig. Skal vi for evigt måske samme vej? Skal vi for evigt måske samme vej? Skal vi for evigt måske samme vej?	8
April 10	All Of Me	John Legend				What would I do without your smart mouth? Drawing me in and you kicking me out. You've got my head spinning, no kidding I can't pin you down. What's going on in that beautiful mind? I'm on your magical mystery ride, and I'm so dizzy don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright. My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine. You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind. 'Cause all of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges. All your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you. You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose, I'm winning. 'Cause I give you all of me and you give me all of you. How many times do I have to tell you? Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too. The world is beating you down. I'm around through every mood. You're my downfall, you're my muse. My worst distraction, my rhythm, and blues. I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you. My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine. You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind. 'Cause all of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges. All your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you. You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose, I'm winning. 'Cause I give you all of me and you give me all of you. Give me all of you. Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts, risking it all though it's hard. Cause all of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges. All your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you. You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose, I'm winning. 'Cause I give you all of me and you give me all of you. I give you all of me, and you give me all of you.	7

	How Great Thou Art (Then Sings my Soul) 	Carrie Underwood				Oh Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder. Consider all the worlds. Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder. Thy power throughout the universe displayed. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. When through the woods and forest glades, I wander. And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees. When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur, and see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. And when I think that God, His Son not sparing. Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in that on the cross my burden gladly bearing. He bled and died to take away my sin. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation, and take me home. What joy shall fill my heart, then I shall bow in humble adoration and then proclaim, "My God, how great Thou art." Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art, how great Thou art.	7.5
	Such Great Heights	Iron & Wine				I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned. And I have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes, like puzzle pieces from the clay. And true, it may seem like a stretch, but it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away. When I am missing you to death. When you are out there on the road for several weeks of shows, and when you scan the radio, I hope this song will guide you home. They will see us waving from such great heights. "Come down now," they'll say, but everything looks perfect from far away. "Come down now," but we'll stay. I tried my best to leave this all on your machine, but the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listenin'. And that frankly will not fly. You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down. And this is guiding you home. They will see us waving from such great heights. "Come down now," they'll say, but everything looks perfect from far away. "Come down now," but we'll stay.	9
	Love and Happiness	Al Green				Oh, baby, love, and happiness (love and happiness). Love and happiness (love and happiness). Hey, hey, hey, hey. Make you do right, love'll make you do wrong. Make you come home early, make you stay out all night long. The power of love, wait a minute let me tell you, oh,  the power, power of love. Power of love, power, make you do right, love'll make you do wrong, ha, yeah. (Love and happiness, love and happiness). Say love (Love and happiness, love, and happiness). Make you want to dance, love, and happiness. Love is, wait a minute, love is, yeah, walkin' together, yeah, talkin' together. Say it again, say it together, yeah.

	True Companion	Marc Cohn				Baby, I've been searching like everybody else, can't say nothing different about myself. Sometimes I'm an angel and sometimes I'm cruel. And when it comes to love, I'm just another fool. Yes, I'll climb a mountain, I'm gonna swim the sea. There ain't no act of God girl could keep you safe from me. My arms are reaching out, out across this canyon. I'm asking you to be my true companion. True companion. True companion. So don't you dare and try to walk away, I've got my heart set on our wedding day. I've got this vision of a girl in white, made my decision that it's you alright. When I take your hand, I'll watch my heart set sail. I'll take my trembling fingers and I'll lift up your veil then I'll take you home. And with wild abandon, make love to you just like a true companion. You are my true companion. I got a true companion, Oh, a true companion. When the years have done irreparable harm, I can see us walking slowly arm in arm just like that couple on the corner do, 'cause girl, I will always be in love with you. When I look in your eyes I'll still see that spark until the shadows fall, until the room grows dark. Then when I leave this earth, I'll be with the angels standin'. I'll be out there waiting for my true companion. Just for my true companion. True companion. True companion.	8
	When God Made You	NewSong				It's always been a mystery to me how two hearts can come together. And love can last forever, but now that I have found you. I believe that a miracle has come when God sends the perfect one. Now gone are all my questions about why. And I've never been so sure of anything in my life. Oh, I wonder what God was thinking when He created you. I wonder if He knew everything I would need because He made all my dreams come true. When God made you, He must have been thinking about me. I promise that wherever you may go, wherever life may lead you with all my heart, I'll be there too. And from this moment on, I want you to know, I'll let nothing come between us, and I will love the ones you love. Now gone are all my questions about why. And I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I wonder what God was thinking when He created you. I wonder if He knew everything I would need because He made all my dreams come true. When God made you, He must have been thinking about me. He made the sun. He made the moon to harmonize a perfect tune. One can't move without the other they just have to be together. And that is why I know its true. You're for me, and I'm for you. Because my world just cant be right with out you in my life. I wonder what God was thinking when He created you. I wonder if He knew everything I would need because he made all my dreams come true. He must have heard every prayer I've been praying. Yes, He knew everything I would need when God made you. (I thank God he made you, yes he did) When dreams come true. (you are my love, my love) When God made you, He must have been thinking about me, ooh.	7
	Patience	Guns N' Roses				Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you. I'm still alright to smile. Girl, I think about you every day now. Was a time when I wasn't sure, but you set my mind at ease. There is no doubt, you're in my heart now. Said, woman, take it slow. It'll work itself out fine. All we need is just a little patience. Said, sugar, make it slow. and we come together fine. All we need is just a little patience (Patience) I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone. If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear. Sometimes I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time, but you know, love, there's one more thing to consider. Said, woman, take it slow, and things will be just fine. You and I'll just use a little patience. Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright. You and I've got what it takes to make it, we won't fake it, I'll never break it 'cause I can't take it. Little patience. Need a little patience. Just a little patience. Some more patience. Need some patience. Could use some patience. Gotta have some patience. All it takes is patience, just a little patience, is all you need. I been walkin' the streets at night, just tryin' to get it right. Hard to see with so many around. You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd, and the streets don't change, but maybe the name. I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you. Yeah, yeah, but I need you. Oh, I need you. Whoa, I need you all this time.	8
	Up Where We Belong (Love Lifted Us Up)	Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes				Who knows what tomorrow brings. In a world, few hearts survive. All I know is the way I feel. When it's real, I keep it alive. The road is long, there are mountains in our way, but we climb a step every day. Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry on a mountain high. Love lift us up where we belong far from the world below, up where the clear wind blow. Some hang on to used to be, live their lives looking behind. All we have is here and now. All our life out there to find. The road is long, there are mountains in our way, but we climb them a step every day. Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry on a mountain high. Love lift us up where we belong far from the world below, up where the clear wind blow. Time goes by. No time to cry, life's you and I alive today. Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry on a mountain high. Love lift us up where we belong far from the world below, up where the clear wind blow. Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry on a mountain high. Love lift us up where we belong.	9
	And Can It Be	Steve Green				And can it be that I should gain, an int'rest in the Savior's blood? Died He for me who caused His pain? For me, who Him to death pursued? Amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God shouldst die for me? Amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God shouldst die for me? Long my imprisoned spirit lay fast bound in sin and nature's night. Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray: I woke the dungeon flamed with light. My chains fell off. My heart was free. I rose, went forth, and followed thee. No condemnation now I dread Jesus, and all in Him is mine. Alive in Him, my living head, and clothed in righteousness divine, bold I approach th'eternal throne. And claim the crown through Christ my own. Amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God shouldst die for me?	10
	The Sweetest Thing	Juice Newton				When I see you in the morning with the sleep still in your eyes, I remember all the laughter and the tears we shared last night. And as we lie here, just two shadows in the light before the dawn. The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you. And I have never been afraid of losing now. And I have never wanted love to be a chain. I only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain. The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you. The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you. Now you and I, we're not children. We have both been loved before. We have given, and we have taken many rides on troubled shores, but all the heartaches and temptations only make me love you more. The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you. And I have never been afraid of losing now. And I have never wanted love to be a chain. I only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain. The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you. The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you.	9
	Because You Loved Me	Celine Dion				For all those times you stood by me, for all the truth that you made me see, for all the joy you brought to my life, for all the wrong that you made right, for every dream you made come true, for all the love I found in you I'll be forever thankful, baby, you're the one who held me up never let me fall. You're the one who saw me through, through it all. You were my strength when I was weak. You were my voice when I couldn't speak. You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You saw the best there was in me. Lifted me up when I couldn't reach. You gave me faith 'cause you believed. I'm everything I am because you loved me. You gave me wings and made me fly. You touched my hand. I could touch the sky. I lost my faith, you gave it back to me. You said no star was out of reach. You stood by me, and I stood tall. I had your love I had it all. I'm grateful for each day you gave me. Maybe I don't know that much, but I know this much is true. I was blessed because I was loved by you. You were my strength when I was weak.

	She’s Everything	Brad Paisley				She's a yellow pair of running shoes. A holey pair of jeans. She looks great in cheap sunglasses. She looks great in anything. She's: "I want a piece of chocolate.", "Take me to a movie." She's: "I can't find a thing to wear." Now and then she's moody. She’s a Porsche with the top down. With her brown hair a-blowing, she's a soft place to land. And a good feeling knowing she's a warm conversation. That, I wouldn't miss for nothing. She's a fighter when she's mad. And she's a lover when she's loving. And she's everything I ever wanted, and everything I need. I talk about her. I go on and on, and on 'cause she's everything to me. She's a Saturday out on the town, and a church girl on Sunday. She's a cross around her neck, and a cuss word 'cause it's Monday. She's a bubble bath and candles. Baby, come and kiss me. She's a one glass of wine, and she's feeling kinda tipsy. She's the giver I wish I could be, and the stealer of the covers. She's a picture in my wallet of my unborn children's mother. She's the hand that I'm holding when I'm on my knees and praying. She's the answer to my prayer, and she's the song that I'm playing. And she's everything I ever wanted, and everything I need. I talk about her. I go on and on, and on 'cause she's everything to me. She's the voice I love to hear someday when I'm ninety. She's that wooden rocking chair I want rocking right beside me. Every day that passes, I only love her more. Yeah, she's the one that I'd lay down my own life for. And she's everything I ever wanted, and everything I need. She's everything to me. Yeah, she's everything to me. Everything I ever wanted, and everything I need. She's everything to me.	7
	All I Want Is You	U2				You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold. You say you want your story to remain untold. But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave when all I want is you. You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it, treasure just to look upon it, all the riches in the night. You say you'll give me eyes in a moon of blindness, a river in a time of dryness, a harbor in the tempest. But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave when all I want is you. You say you want your love to work out right, to last with me through the night. You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold, your story to remain untold, your love not to grow cold. All the promises we break from the cradle to the grave when all I want is you. You all I want is, you all I want is, you all I want is, you.	10
	She’s Got This Thing About Her	Chris Young				It might be her smile cause it can change my day. Blue eyes that chase my blues away. Might be her touch that keeps me coming back for more. Her loving words that keep me going strong. That heart of hers I hang my future on what it is well I can't say for sure. It's just she's got this thing about her. She's got this thing about her like that magic in your favorite song. You just can't put your finger on. In her arms when we're all alone, I get the feeling that I've come back home, she's got this thing about her. She stops time when she moves through a room. When she leaves, she's always gone too soon, and I'm counting down the minutes till she's back. She's the love I've known eternally that always feels brand new to me. I can't separate the fiction from the fact. It's just she's got this thing about her. She's got this thing about her like a hymn in a cathedral hall. Watching April snowflakes fall. In her arms when we're all alone. I get the feeling that I've come back home. She's got this thing about her like the magic in your favorite song. You just can't put your finger on. She's got this thing about her.	8.5
	You Are The Reason	Calum Scott & Leona Lewis				There goes my heart beating cause you are the reason, I'm losing my sleep, please, come back now. There goes my mind racing, and you are the reason that I'm still breathing. I'm hopeless now. I'd climb every mountain, and swim every ocean just to be with you. And fix what I've broken. Oh, cause I need you to see that you are the reason. There goes my hands shaking and you are the reason, my heart keeps bleeding, I need you now, oh. If I could turn back the clock, I'd make sure the light defeated the dark. I'd spend every hour, of every day, oh, keeping you safe, oh. I'd climb every mountain, and swim every ocean just to be with you. And fix what I've broken. Oh, cause I need you to see that you are the reason. I don't want to fight no more. I don't want to hide no more. I don't want to cry no more. Come back I need you to hold me. (That you are the reason) A little closer now, just a little closer now. Come a little closer I need you to hold me tonight. I'd climb every mountain, and swim every ocean just to be with you. And fix what I've broken.

	Through The Years	Kenny Rogers				I can't remember when you weren't there. When I didn't care for anyone but you. I swear we've been through everything there is. Can't imagine anything we've missed. Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do. Through the years, you've never let me down. You turned my life around. The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you. Through the years, I've never been afraid. I've loved the life we've made, and I'm so glad I've stayed. Right here with you, through the years. I can't remember what I used to do. Who I trusted whom, I listened to before. I swear you've taught me everything I know. Can't imagine needing someone so. But through the years it seems to me. I need you more, and more, Through the years, through all the good and bad. I knew how much we had. I've always been so glad to be with you. Through the years, it's better everyday, you've kissed my tears away. As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you. Through the years. Through the years, when everything went wrong. Together we were strong. I know that I belonged right here with you. Through the years, I never had a doubt. We'd always work things out. I've learned what love's about, by loving you, through the years. Through the years, you've never let me down. You've turned my life around. The sweetest days I've found. I've found with you, through the years. It's better everyday, you've kissed my tears away. As long as it's okay. I'll stay with you. Through the years.	7.5

Don't matter long as I've got your love. I don't ever want to wake up lookin' into someone else's eyes. Another voice calling me baby on the other end of the phone.

	There Is Love (The Wedding Song)	Peter, Paul & Mary				He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts. Rest assured, this troubadour is acting on his part. The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain. For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name, there is love, there is love. A man shall leave his mother, and a woman leaves her home. And they shall travel on to where the two shall be as one. As it was, in the beginning, is now and til the end. Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again, and there is love, there is love. Well, then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife? Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life? And if loving is the answer, then who's the giving for? Do you believe in something that you've never seen before? Oh, there's love, there is love. Oh, the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain. For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name, there is love, there is love.	9.5
	But For Now	Jamie Cullum				Sure, I know you'd like to have me talk about my future. And a million words or so to fill you in 'bout my past. Have I sisters or a brother? When's my birthday? How's my mother? Well, my dear, in time I'll answer all those things you ask. But for now, I'll just say I love you. Nothing more seems important somehow. And tomorrow can wait come whatever, let me love you forever,  but right now, right now. Some fine day when we go walking, we'll take time for idle talking, sharing every feeling as we watch each other smile. I'll hold your hand. You'll hold my hand. We'll say things we never had planned. Then we'll get to know each other in a little while. But for now, let me say, I love you. Later on, there'll be time for so much more, but for now, meaning now and forever. Let me kiss you, my darling, then once more, once more. But for now, let me say, I love you. Later on, I must know much more of you. But for now, here and now, how I love you. As you are in my arms, I love you, I love you, I love you.	9

	Never knew I needed by Ne-Yo	Ne-Yo				For the way, you changed my plans. For being the perfect distraction. For the way, you took the idea that I had of everything that I wanted to have and made me see there was something missing, oh yeah. For the ending of my first beginning (Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah). And for the rare and unexpected friend (Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah).

	The Way You Look Tonight	Steve Tyrell				Someday, when I'm awfully low. When the world is cold, I will feel the glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight. Oh, but you're lovely with your smile so warm. And your cheeks so soft. There is nothing for me, but to love you just the way you look tonight. With each word, your tenderness grows. Tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose touches my foolish heart. You're so lovely never ever change, keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it? 'Cause I love you just the way you look tonight. You're so lovely never ever change, keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it? 'Cause I love you just the way you look tonight.

	Known by Tauren Wells	Tauren Wells				It's so unusual, it's frightening you see right through the mess inside me. And You call me out to pull me in. You tell me I can start again, and I don't need to keep on hiding. I'm fully known and loved by You. You won't let go, no matter what I do. And it's not one or the other, it's hard truth and ridiculous grace to be known, fully known, and loved by You. I'm fully known and loved by You. It's so like You to keep pursuing. It's so like me to go astray, but You guard my heart with Your truth. A kind of love that's bulletproof, and I surrender to Your kindness. I'm fully known and loved by You. You won't let go, no matter what I do. And it's not one or the other, it's hard truth and ridiculous grace to be known, fully known, and loved by You. I'm fully known and loved by You. How real? How wide? How rich? How high is Your heart? I cannot find the reasons why you give me so much. How real? How wide? How rich? How high is Your heart? I cannot find the reasons why you give me so much.

	If We Were Vampires by Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit 	Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit				It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in or the light coming off of your skin. The fragile heart you protected for so long or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong. It's not your hands searching slow in the dark or your nails leaving love's watermark. It's not the way you talk me off the roof, your questions like directions to the truth. It's knowing that this can't go on forever, likely one of us will have to spend some days alone. Maybe we'll get forty years together, but one day I'll be gone, or one day you'll be gone. If we were vampires and death was a joke. We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke, laugh at all the lovers, and their plans. I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand. Maybe time running out is a gift. I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift and give you every second I can find. And hope it isn't me who's left behind. It's knowing that this can't go on forever, likely one of us will have to spend some days alone. Maybe we'll get forty years together, but one day I'll be gone, or one day you'll be gone.

	Shelter by Ray Lamontagne	Ray LaMontagne				I guess you don't need it. I guess you don't want me to repeat it, but everything I have to give, I'll give to you. It's not like we planned it. You tried to stay, but you could not stand it. To see me shut down, slow as though it was an easy thing to do. Listen, when all of this around us will fall over, I tell you what we're gonna do. Hey, you will shelter me, my love. And I, I will shelter you, I will shelter you. I left you heartbroken, but not until those very words were spoken. Has anybody ever made such a fool outta you? It's hard to believe it even as my eyes do see it. The very things that make you live, they're killing you. Listen, when all of this around us will fall over, I tell you what we're gonna do. Hey, you will shelter me, my love. And I, I will shelter you, I will shelter you. I will shelter you, I will shelter you, I will shelter you. Listen, when all of this around us will fall over, I tell you what we're gonna do. Hey, you will shelter me, my love. And I, I will shelter you if you shelter me too. I will shelter you, I will shelter you.	9

	There She Is by Frank Turner	Frank Turner				I have wandered through the dark. Through the dirt, I was hurt, and in the end, I came back to the start. And I stumbled, Lord knows how I stumble. I slipped on myself, no help from anyone else. I fell in love, and I was humbled. There she is, isn't she everything? There she is, isn't she everything? Down at the bottom, I found the things I'd forgotten. Then despite all I've done, I can learn, I can learn. And this time I'm gonna hold onto them. I'm gonna forgive myself, and then ask for forgiveness. Crossing my fingers and toes 'cause God only knows, I need this. Lord, how I need this. There she is, isn't she everything? There she is, isn't she everything? Isn't she everything I need? I needed someone who believed me. I needed someone who wouldn't leave me. I needed her everything I need.

And even if the sun refused to shine, even if romance ran out of rhyme, you would still have my heart until the end of time. You're all I need, my love, my Valentine. All of my life, I have been waiting for all you give to me. You've opened my eyes and shown me how to love unselfishly.

	Can't Help Falling in Love	Elvis Presley				Wise men say, "Only fools rush in." but I can't help falling in love with you. Shall I stay, would it be a sin? If I can't help falling in love with you? Like a river flows surely to the sea, darling, so it goes some things are meant to be. Take my hand, take my whole life, too, for I can't help falling in love with you.

	Living Our Love Song by Jason Michael Carroll	Jason Michael Carroll				Baby, when I look at you with your hair falling down in your baby blues. Standing there across the room, I get so lost in the way you move. It makes me reminisce, back to years ago on a night like this. Teary-eyed, as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man.

	Take My Breath Away	Berlin				Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game on this endless ocean. Finally, lovers know no shame. Turning and returning to some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion as you turn around, and say take my breath away, take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love. Never hesitating to become the fated ones. Turning and returning to some secret place to find. Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say, my love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass, I saw you. In time you slipped away when the mirror crashed I called you and turned to hear you say. If only for today I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning to some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion as you turn my way, and say take my breath away, my love. Take my breath away, my love. Take my breath away, my love. Take my breath away, my love.	9

	You	Chris Young				The bluest skies don't seem so blue, and the stars seem to be a little dimmer too. Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame. Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is no one gets me like you when you kiss me. Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band. I thought I knew what love was, but I didn't have a clue. I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you. Gotta whole new direction it seems these days.

	Memphis Soul Song	Uncle Kracker				Lookin' back on everything, and all the things that stay. I can count on memories 'cuz they don't go away. Good times were hard to hold until she came along. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. I'm not always there I know, but she don't mind at all. As pretty as a picture that hangs on my own wall, she's like Mississippi. When the sun comes up at dawn, she moves me like a Memphis soul song. With an angel on my lefty side, and the devil on my right. She's the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights, of all the ones who've left me it's a wonder she's not gone. She moves me, like a Memphis soul song. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. She don't care what the game is. She's always down to play. My world without her seems a million miles away. She don't have to worry. I know where I belong. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. I've been dealt some aces, and I've played them all the same, but she's the only one that keeps me in the game. No fame or fortune could ever keep me gone. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. With an angel on my lefty side and the devil on my right, she's the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights. Of all the ones who've left me, it's a wonder she's not gone. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. There's a magic down in Memphis that never seems to fade. Even now them voices carry like a lonely serenade. It's the memories that still and always will be on my mind. They move me every time. She sees the good in everything there is to see. Sometimes I wonder what she ever see's in me. I'm not always right you know, but she's never led me wrong. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. In all my travels, I've never found a way to find the words that say the things I'd like to say. I've sang some melodies, but she's my favorite one. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. With an angel on my lefty side and the devil on my right. She's the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights of all the ones who've left me it's a wonder she's not gone. She moves me like a Memphis soul song. She moves me like a Memphis soul song.	6

Must be nice having someone who understands the life you live. Must be nice having someone who's slow to take and quick to give. Must be nice having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick. Someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion. Must be nice having someone who loves you despite your faults. Must be nice having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk. Must be nice having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too. Someone who loves you for sure. You just remember to never let 'em go. 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone, she'll be by your side still holding on and even when those 20s stop spinning, and all those gold-digging women disappear. She'll still be here. Must be nice having someone you can come home to from a long day of work. Must be nice having someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts. Must be nice having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard. Someone as mighty as a lion, but still as gentle as a bluebird. Must be nice having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone. Must be nice having someone you can grow old with until God calls her home. Must be nice having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too. Someone who loves you for sure. You never let 'em go. 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone, she'll be by your side still holding on and even when those 20s stop spinning, and all those gold-digging women disappear. She'll still be here. She'll still be here. Even when your hustling days are gone, she'll be by your side still holding on. Even when those 20s stop spinning, and all those gold-digging women disappear. She'll still be here. 'Cause even when your hustling days are gone, she'll be by your side still holding on and even when those 20s stop spinning, and all those gold-digging women disappear. She'll still be here.	6

	The Reason	Hoobastank				I'm not a perfect person. There's many things I wish I didn't do, but I continue learning. I never meant to do those things to you, and so I have to say before I go.

	Woman, Amen	Dierks Bentley				I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind if I faced one day on my own. I know I was saved, the night that she gave this drifter's heart a home.

April 12	My Best Friend	Tim McGraw				I never had no one I could count on. I've been let down so many times. I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin' 'til you walked into my life.

Now I wonder how I could have been so blind, and for the first time, I am looking in your eyes. For the first time, I'm seeing who you are. I can't believe how much I see when you're looking back at me. Now I understand what love is, love is, for the first time. Can this be real? Can this be true?

	Bless The Broken Road 	Rascal Flatts				I set out on a narrow way many years ago, hoping I would find true love along the broken road, but I got lost a time or two; wiped my brow and kept pushing through, I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you. Every long lost dream led me to where you are, others who broke my heart. They were like Northern stars pointing me on my way into your loving arms. This much I know is true that God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you. (Yes, He did) I think about the years I spent just passing through, I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you, but you just smile and take my hand. You've been there, you understand; it's all part of a grander plan that is coming true. Every long lost dream led me to where you are, others who broke my heart. They were like Northern stars pointing me on my way into your loving arms. This much I know is true that God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you.

	Make My Life With You	The Oak Ridge Boys				Here in the day. Here in the light. All I can see is you last night. Lit by the moon still by my side, loving arms open wide, and the love that comes over me is enough to make me stay. Is it life lived separately? Is life all it ought to be? Oh, if it were up to me, I'd make my life with you. Some people say it's a dangerous game. I'll take my chances just the same if love is a game, and you are the prize. You standing here is no surprise, and the love that comes over me is enough to make me stay. Is it life lived separately? Is life all it ought to be? Oh, if it were up to me, I'd make my life with you. Is it life lived separately? Is life all it ought to be? Oh, if it were up to me, I'd make my life with you. Is it life lived separately?

	In Your Eyes 	Peter Gabriel				Love, I get so lost, sometimes. Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart. When I want to run away, I drive off in my car, but whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are. All my instincts they return and the grand facade, so soon will burn. Without a noise, without my pride, I reach out from the inside. In your eyes, the light, the heat. In your eyes, I am complete. In your eyes, I see the doorway to a thousand churches. In your eyes, the resolution of all the fruitless searches. In your eyes, I see the light and the heat. In your eyes. Oh, I want to be that complete. I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes. Love, I don't like to see so much pain, so much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away. I get so tired of working so hard for our survival. I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive. And all my instincts they return and the grand facade, so soon will burn. Without a noise, without my pride, I reach out from the inside. In your eyes, the light the heat. In your eyes, I am complete. In your eyes, I see the doorway to a thousand churches. In your eyes, the resolution of all the fruitless searches. In your eyes, I see the light and the heat. In your eyes. Oh, I want to be that complete. I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes. In your eyes, in your eyes.

	Destiny 	Jim Brickman				What if I never knew? What if I never found you? I'd never have this feeling in my heart. How did this come to be? I don't know how you found me, but from the moment I saw you, deep inside my heart I knew. Baby, you're my destiny. You and I were meant to be. With all my heart and soul. I give my love to have and hold, and as far as I can see you were always meant to be, my destiny. I wanted someone like you. Someone that I could hold on to, and give my love until the end of time, but forever was just a word. Something I'd only heard about, but now you're always there for me. When you say forever, I believe. Baby, you're my destiny. You and I were meant to be. With all my heart and soul. I give my love to have and hold, and as far as I can see you were always meant to be, my destiny. Maybe all we need is just a little faith, 'cause baby I believe, that love will find the way, hey, yeah. Baby, you're my destiny. You and I were meant to be. With all my heart and soul. I give my love to have and hold, and as far as I can see from now until eternity. You were always meant to be, my destiny. You're my destiny.	8.5
	I'll Be 	Edwin McCain				The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful, stop me and steal my breath. Emeralds from mountains and thrust towards the sky never revealing their depth. Tell me that we belong together, dress it up with the trappings of love. I'll be captivated. I'll hang from your lips instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above.

	Homesick	Kane Brown				Dancing in the kitchen. You singing my favorite songs. Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs. How you swear you love me more when you're whispering goodnight. All those little moments are every reason why I'm homesick. This feeling that I'm feeling, no, it don't quit. It's like half of me is missing, heaven knows it. That all I wanna do is be alone with your brown eyes, all tangled up, just holding onto you tonight until the morning. Baby, that's the damn truth.

I've made my mind up, girl, it's meant to be. Someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me. Someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me. It's written down somewhere it's got to be. You're high above me flyin' wild and free. Oh, but someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me. Someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me. Someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me. Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea. I feel it in my soul it's meant to be. Oh someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me. Someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me.	8
	When The Rain comes 	Third Day				When the rain comes, it seems that everyone has gone away. When the night falls, you wonder if you shouldn't find someplace to run and hide, escape the pain, but hiding's such a lonely thing to do. I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again. I can't stop the rain, but I will hold you 'til it goes away. When the rain comes, you blame it on the things that you have done. When the storm fades, you know that rain must fall on everyone. Rest awhile. It'll be alright. No one loves you like I do. When the rain comes, I will hold you.	13
	Entwined	Tim Myers				Something in your eyes say you're falling in. You're a part of me. You're under my skin. Every piece of me has felt so incomplete 'til you came into my life. You and I are so entwined. I always knew that I was made for you. Lover, don't you know you're so beautiful? You're inside my heart. You're inside my soul. When I see you move and laugh the way you do, I am melting into you. You and I are so entwined. I always knew that I was made for you. You and I are so entwined. I always knew that I was made for you.	13
	Cinderella (The Wedding Song) 	Rogers and Hammerstein				The fields are aglow in autumn yellow and the sky is a robin’s egg blue. It makes you wish when you fall asleep you will dream about the view. Bizarre and improbable and pretty as a page from the fairy-tale books. It makes you wish that the world could be as lovely as it looks all around you. The same sweet sound you can hear from the earth, and down from the sky. What a lucky girl, what a lucky guy. Got your girl, got your guy. Someone wants you. You know who. Now you’re living the music in you.  Now you can go wherever you want to go. Now you can do whatever you want to do. Now you can be whatever you want to be. And love is the song that you’ll sing your whole life through. (Love is the song that you’ll sing for your whole life). Move a mountain, light the sky, make a wish come true. There is music in you.	10
	Africa	Toto				I hear the drums echoing tonight, but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation. She's coming in twelve-thirty flight. Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation. I stopped an old man along the way, hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies. He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you." It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa, gonna take some time to do the things we never had. The wild dogs cry out in the night as they grow restless longing for some solitary company. I know that I must do what's right. Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti. I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become. It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa, gonna take some time to do the things we never had. "Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you." It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa, gonna take some time to do the things we never had.	8
	You're The One	Gyth Rigdon				She walks in a crowded room. Hair is down. Her eyes are blue. She takes a seat next to me, hypnotizing with a smell so sweet. And took my breath away from me and made it hard, hard to speak, hmm. I've gone through the mountains, past the sun over the ocean searching for the one. Gives me strength and gives me hope. So I don't walk this life alone. Without love, I'm flying blind. Take my hand, let's ride tonight through the mountains past the sun over the ocean, you're the one. And now you're here by my side. Heaven sent, meet her from the sky. Happiness is hard to beat. Just so, smile brings me to my knees. I promise you that I will be everything that you'll ever need, hmm.

Take my hand, let's ride tonight through the mountains past the sun over the ocean, you're the one. Ooh, you're the one.	8
	Consider Me by Allen Stone	Allen Stone				If you're lookin' for somebody who will love you through the night. And be there in the morning with the same look in their eyes. If you lookin' for somebody who will listen to your thoughts and understand the way you feel with no words at all. If you need appreciation without compensation. Someone to give you what you need. If you lookin' for some magic, that will not end tragic. Darling, all I ask is that you consider me. Consider me, consider me, consider me. Won't you consider me? Consider me, consider me, consider me. Won't you consider me? If you're lookin' for somebody who don't judge you from your past. And focuses on all the things that help to make it last. If you're lookin' for somebody who will put up with your shit. Can fight fire with fire without burning you a bit. Oh, if you want real attraction beyond, this skin we fashion. Someone to set your spirit free. Someone that you're obsessed with and that you feel blessed with. Baby, all I ask is you consider me. Consider me (won't you consider me?). Consider me (won't you consider me?). Consider me (won't you consider me?). Won't you consider me? Consider me (won't you consider me?). Consider me (won't you consider me?).

And any time of day I'll be there right away, swear it on my grave if you consider me. Ooh darling, oh yeah, won't you consider me?	7.5
	Look at me	Carrie Underwood				I would bet my life like I bet my heart that you were the one, baby. I've never been so sure of anything before. You driving my heart crazy. I can't hold out, I can't hold back now like I've done before. Darling, look at me, I've fallen like a fool for you. Darling, can't you see I'd do anything you want me to. I tell myself, I'm in too deep, then I fall a little farther every time you look at me. How do you do that, babe? Make me feel like I'm the only girl alive for you. I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this. First time in your arms, I knew. The way you held me, I knew that this could be what I've been waiting to find. Darling, look at me, I've fallen like a fool for you. Darling, can't you see I'd do anything you want me to. I tell myself, I'm getting in too deep, then I fall a little farther every time you look at me. Every time you look at me.	10
	I Choose You 	Sara Bareilles				Let the bough break, let it come down crashing. Let the sun fade out to a dark sky. I can't say I'd even notice it was absent 'cause I could live by the light in your eyes. I'll unfold before you what I've strung together. The very first words of a lifelong love letter. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours, and you will become mine, I choose you, I choose you, yeah. There was a time when I would have believed them if they told me you could not come true, just love's illusion, but then you found me, and everything changed. And I believe in something again. My whole heart will be yours forever. This is a beautiful start to a lifelong love letter. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. I will become yours, and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you. We are not perfect. We'll learn from our mistakes. And as long as it takes, I will prove my love to you. I am not scared of the elements. I am under-prepared, but I am willing. And even better, I get to be the other half of you. Tell the world that we finally got it all right. I choose you. Yeah, I will become yours, and you will become mine. I choose you. I choose you. I choose you.	8
	If I Ever Saw A Good Thing	Great White				If I ever saw a good thing, baby, it's you. If I ever had a sweet dream, baby, it's you. There ain't nothing else I want to do, but spend my time loving you. If I ever saw a good thing, baby, it's you. They say that one time in your life you'll find the one who'll stand beside you no matter where you go, and I know that must be true 'cause, baby, I found you. If I ever had a good thing, baby, it's you. You know that everybody needs someone to love 'cause it's a lonesome soul who walks alone, but I don't know what I'd do, baby, if I didn't have you 'cause it's a long and lonesome road to walk alone. If I ever saw a good thing, baby, it's you. If I ever had a sweet dream, baby, it's you.	11
	Made to Love You 	Gerald Levert				I recalled when we first met a long time ago. How could I forget the way I felt when I first laid eyes on you. I remember saying to my friends, "There is my future wife,' and then I took the steps to meet someone who would change my life. It had to be my destiny 'cause I was made to love ya. My hands to touch ya, my arms to hold ya, my legs to stand, my time to spend with you forever. I was made, made to love ya. My lips to kiss ya, my eyes to see you, my legs to stand, my time to spend with you forever, and ever. I was made (I was made), made to love ya (made to love ya). I remember our first date, our first argument. Our very first break up to make up that got us to this moment. And every girlfriend and every one night stand, every heartbreak, every heartache led me to ya. It drove me to ya, made me better, better suited for ya. I was made, made, my lips to kiss. These eyes of mine, oh baby, baby, baby, together I was made, I was made to love you, love you. My hands, only you, me, and God knows how deep this love goes, baby, oh baby, baby. I was made, my lips to kiss you, my eyes to see you, my legs to stand for you and only you baby. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I was made to love you. All over the world, you will be girl baby. Baby, oh, oh, forever and ever. How long is eternity? That's how long we'll be together forever. My legs won't stand without ya. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, made to love you, baby,  from head to toe. Only you, me and God knows I was made, made to ya.	7.5

	Remind Me 	Brad Paisley				We didn't care if people stared. We'd make out in a crowd somewhere. Somebody'd tell us to get a room. It's hard to believe that was me and you. Now, we keep saying that we're okay, but I don't want to settle for good, not great. I miss the way that it felt back then, I wanna feel that way again. Been so long, bet you forget the way I used to kiss your neck. Remind me, remind me. So on fire, so in love way back when we couldn't get enough. Remind me, remind me. Remember the airport dropping me off? We were kissing goodbye, and we couldn't stop. And I felt bad 'cause you missed your flight, but that meant we had one more night. Do you remember how it used to be? We'd turn out the lights, and we didn't just sleep. Remind me, baby, remind me. Oh, so on fire, so in love that look in your eyes that I miss so much. Remind me, baby, remind me. I wanna feel that way. Yeah, I wanna hold you close. Oh, if you still love me, don't just assume I know. Oh, baby, remind me, remind me. Do you remember the way it felt?

	Under My Skin	Frank Sinatra				I've got you under my skin. I've got you deep in the heart of me. So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me. I've got you under my skin. I'd tried so not to give in. I said to myself, "This affair never will go so well," but why should I try to resist when baby, I know so well, I've got you under my skin. I'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of havin' you near. In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night, and repeats, repeats in my ear. Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? Use your mentality, wake up to reality. But each time that I do, just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin. 'Cause I've got you under my skin. I would sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of havin' you near. In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night, and repeats, how it yells in my ear. Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality? But each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop just before I begin. 'Cause I've got you under my skin. Yes, I've got you under my skin.	9

	Captain Fantastic & the Brown Dirt Cowboy	Elton John				Captain Fantastic, raised and regimented, hardly a hero. Just someone his mother might know very clearly. A case for Corn Flakes and classics, "Two teas both with sugar, please." In the back of an alley while little dirt cowboys turned brown in their saddles. Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer for its hay make and "Hey mom, do the papers say anything good? Are there chances in life for little dirt cowboys? Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?" Brown Dirt Cowboy still green and growing city slick. Captain Fantastic the feedback, the honey, the hive could be holding for there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter. Broken young children on the wheels of the winners. And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning. For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range. Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change. We've thrown in the towel, too many times out for the count and when we're down. Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy from the end of the world to your town. And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us. Mmm, couldn't fool us, for we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire. Hand in hand went music and the rhyme. The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring from here on sonny, sonny, sonny, it's a long and lonely climb. For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range. Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change. We've thrown in the towel, too many times out for the count and when we're down. Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy from the end of the world to your town. We've thrown in the towel, too many times out for the count and when we're down.

	Again by Lenny Kravitz	Lenny Kravitz				I've been searching for you. I heard a cry within my soul. I've never had a yearning quite like this before. Now here you are, walking right through my door. All of my life, where have you been? I wonder if I'll ever see you again, and if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. A sacred gift of heaven, for better worse, wherever and I would never let somebody break you down or take your crown, never. All of my life, where have you been? I wonder if I'll ever see you again, and if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. I've searched through time. I've always known that you were there, upon your throne. A lonely queen without her king. I've longed for you, my love, forever. All of my life, where have you been? I wonder if I'll ever see you again, and if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. All of my life, where have you been?

	Satin Sheets 	Tammy Wynette				Satin sheets to lie on, satin pillows to cry on. Still, I'm not happy, don't you see? Big long Cadillac tailor-made upon my back. Still, I want you to set me free. I found another man who can give the more you can. Though you've given me everything money can buy. But your money can't hold me tight like he does on a long, long night. You know you didn't keep me satisfied. Satin sheets to lie on, satin sheets to lie on. We've been through thick and thin. Together braved the fair and stormy weather. We've had all the hard times, you and I. And now that I'm a big success, you called today, and you confused. And told me things that make me want to die. You told me there's another man who can give more than I can. And I've given everything that cash will buy. You can buy me a peaceful night with loving arms around me tight, and you're too busy to notice the hurt in my eyes.	10

	Islands In The Stream	Kenny Rogers feat. Dolly Parton				Baby, when I met you, there was peace unknown. I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside. There was something going on. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart. We got something going on. Tender love is blind. It requires a dedication. All this love we feel needs no conversation. We ride it together, ah-ha. Making love with each other, ah-ha. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. No one in between. How can we be wrong? Sail away with me to another world. And we rely on each other, ah-ha. From one lover to another, ah-ha. I can't live without you. If the love was gone, everything is nothing. If you got no one and you just walk in the night, slowly losing sight of the real thing. But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt. Too deep in love and we got no way out and the message is clear. This could be the year for the real thing. No more will you cry. Baby, I will hurt you never. We start and end as one in love forever. We can ride it together, ah-ha. Making love with each other, ah-ha. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. No one in between. How can we be wrong? Sail away with me to another world and we rely on each other, ah-ha. From one lover to another, ah-ha. Sail away. Ooooh, come sail away with me Islands in the stream, that is what we are. No one in between. How can we be wrong? Sail away with me to another world and we rely on each other, ah-ha. From one lover to another, ah-ha. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. No one in between. How can we be wrong? Sail away with me to another world and we rely on each other, ah-ha. From one lover to another, ah-ha. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. No one in between.	7
	Moondance	Van Morrison				Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance with the stars up above in your eyes. A fantabulous night to make romance, 'neath the cover of October skies. And all the leaves on the trees are falling to the sound of the breezes that blow. And I'm trying to please to the calling of your heart-strings that play soft and low. And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush, and all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush. Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love? Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love? Well, I wanna make love to you tonight. I can't wait 'til the morning has come, and I know that the time is just right, and straight into my arms you will run. And when you come my heart will be waiting to make sure that you're never alone. There and then all my dreams will come true, dear. There and then I will make you my own.

	She's My Kind Of Rain	Tim McGraw				She's my kind of rain like love in a drunken sky. She's confetti falling down all night. She sits quietly there like water in a jar. Says, baby why are you trembling like you are? So I wait and I try. I confess like a child. She's my kind of rain like love from a drunken sky. Confetti falling down all night. She's my kind of rain. She's the sunset shadows. She's like Rembrandt's light. She's the history that's made at night. She's my lost companion. She's my dreaming tree. Together in this brief eternity, summer days, winter snows, she's all things to behold. She's my kind of rain like love from a drunken sky. Confetti falling down all night. She's my kind of rain. So I wait and I try. I confess all my crimes. She's my kind of rain like love from a drunken sky. Confetti falling down all night. She's my kind of rain.

	Cherish The Treasure	Steve Green				I cherish the treasure, the treasure of you. Lifelong companion, I give myself to you. God has enabled me to walk with you faithfully and cherish the treasure, the treasure of you. As I obey the Spirit's voice and seek to do His will, I then can see the wisdom of His plan. For as He works His will in me, I then can love you selflessly and by His grace, can pledge my love to you. This sacred vow I make to you does not contain an "if" though I'm aware that trials lie ahead. I will love you and pray with you and through it all, I will stay with you. Our home will be a refuge of unconditional love. This sacred vow I make to you does not contain an "if" though I'm aware that trials lie ahead.

	Mine Would Be You	Blake Shelton				What's your all-time high, your good-as-it-gets? Your hands down best ever make-up sex? What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?

Mine would be you. Sun-kissed shining, back-road flying. Singing like crazy fools, making up our own words, laughing 'til it hurts. Baby, if I had to choose, my best day ever, my finest hour, my wildest dream come true, mine would be you. What's your double dare, your go-all-in? The craziest thing you ever did? Plain as your name in this tattoo. Look on my arm, mine would be you. Mine would be you. Sun-kissed shining, back-road flying. Singing like crazy fools, making up our own words, laughing 'til it hurts. Baby, if I had to choose, my best day ever, my finest hour, my wildest dream come true, mine would be you. What's the greatest chapter in your book? Are there pages where it hurts to look? What's the one regret you can't work through? You got it, baby, mine would be you. Yeah, you got it, baby, mine would be you. Mine would be you. Tail lights fading, daylight breaking. Standing there like a fool when I should've been running. Yellin' out something to make you wanna hold on to the best love ever. Girl, can you tell me the one thing you'd rather die than lose? 'Cause mine would be you, mine would be you, you.	7.5

	The First Time I Loved Forever	Marion Aunor				The first time I loved forever was when you whispered my name and I knew at once you loved me for the me of who I am. The first time I loved forever, I cast all else aside and I bid my heart to follow. Be there no more need to hide. And if wishes and dreams are merely for children, and if love's tale for fools, I'll live the dream with you. For all my life and forever, there's a truth I'll always know. When my world divides and shatters, you love is where I'll go.	13

	Staring at the Sun  	Jason Aldean				She's like staring at the sun. She could easily blind someone. Other women, I see none. She's like staring at the sun. She gets on to you under your skin like a tattoo. She'll always be there. She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song. She ain't going nowhere. She's like standing in the rain. Washes all my cares away. At the end of a long, hot day. She's like standing in the rain. Oh, she gets on to you under your skin like a tattoo. She'll always be there. She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song. She ain't going nowhere. She gets on to you under your skin like a tattoo. She'll always be there. She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song. She ain't going nowhere. She's like finally coming home and seeing that light in the window on. After being gone too long. She's like finally coming home. Standing in the rain..Staring at the sun.	10
	Don't go chasing waterfalls	T.L.C.				A lonely mother gazing out of the window. Staring at a son that she just can't touch. If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side, but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much. But all the praying just ain't helping at all. 'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble. So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how. Another body laying cold in the gutter. Listen to me. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, but he just can't see. She gives him loving that his body can't handle. But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me"". One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror. But he doesn't recognize his own face. His health is fading and he doesn't know why. Three letters took him to his final resting place. Y'all, don't hear me. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. Come on! I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms. Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray. Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray. All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days. And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo. The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew. Clear blue and unconditional skies. Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries. My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope with such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain. Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein? What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain. You claim the insane, and name this day in time. For falling prey to crime. I say the system's got you victim to your own mind. Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true. Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me, and you. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast.	5

	I don't know what she said	Blaine Larsen				No hablo español. Was all I knew of the local lingo. That old pocket guide to Mexico. Wasn't much help to this out of place Gringo.

Well, I love the way that it rolled off her tongue. I don't know what she said. But I sure liked the way that she said it. As I followed her down the hallway, I was trying my best not to stare.

	To Get Me to You	Lila McCann				Well I still can remember times when the nights seemed to surround me. I was sure the sun would never shine on me. And I, thought it my destiny to walk this world alone, but now you're here with me, now you're here with me. And I don't regret the rain or the nights I felt the pain or the tears I had to cry so much. Times along the way every road I had to take. Every time my heart would break, it was just something that I had to get through to get me to you, get me to you, get me to you. Well I still can recall the days when I had no love around me.

Every time my heart would break, it was just something that I had to get through to get me to you, get me to you, get me to you. Oh yea. And if I could I wouldn't change a thing (wouldn't change a thing baby). Because your love was waiting there for me (Waiting there for me baby). And I don't regret the rain or the nights I felt the pain or the tears I had to cry so much. Times along the way. Every road I had to take, every time my heart would break, it was just something that I had to get through to get me to you, to get me to you, to get me to you. Ohhh.	7.5

	Give me a lifetime	Anthem Lights				Dear God, just saw an angel with my own eyes. And now she's the only thing on my mind. Now I may be out of line, is there any way that I can make her mine? Give me a lifetime. That's all that I'm asking for. Give me a lifetime. Not a second less, not a moment more. Hey, girl, not exactly sure where to start. Want to give you the world, but I don't have it yet. So darling, here's my heart. Now I may run out of time but I would gladly spend my life just to try. Give me a lifetime. That's all that I'm asking for. Give me a lifetime. Not a second less, not a moment more. Baby, we will both find everything that we're looking for. Give me a lifetime. Not a second less, not a moment more. I want nothing more. Dear God, just saw an angel with my own eyes.	10.8
	Crazy In Love	Eminem				Tell myself that I was doing alright. There's nothing left to do tonight, but go crazy on you, crazy on you. Let me go crazy, crazy on you. Can't you see what you do to me, baby? You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac. I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick. You're truly the only one who can do this to me. You just make me get so crazy. I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic. One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex. You make me crazy, the way we act. Like two maniacs in the sack..We fuck like two jackrabbits. And maybe that's a bad habit. 'Cause the next day we're right back at it In the same exact pattern. What the fuck is the matter with us? We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love. What's that that's attractin' us to each other? They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother. Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch. But I stay and still stick it out with you. Even though I just hit you today but you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you. Just 'cause I came home late last night. Crawled in bed and I woke you. But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby, because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am. 'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes, but if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side. Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises. Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes. You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore. You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture than those other little hoes who just act like little girls. Like they're in middle school still. You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill. And you play your position, you never step outta line. Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine. I wonder what's on your mind. Sometimes they say love is blind. Maybe that's why the first time. I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved. Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love. Go crazy on you, crazy on you. Let me go crazy, crazy on you. You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad. The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap. You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence. If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this. As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me. As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do. You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire. You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter. The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table. If you were to break I'd fall on my face, but I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much. As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage,ut you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe. If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be. You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady. The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie. You are the word that I'm lookin' for. When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside. And the right one just won't come to my mind. You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me. The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me. You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me. You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me. And no matter how much, too much is never enough. Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love. Go crazy on you, crazy on you. Let me go crazy, crazy on you.	4.5
	I'll be here for you 	Robert Earl Keen				Good times come, then they go. The rain will fall, the wind will blow. Through it all, you gotta know, I'll do what I can do to protect you, right or wrong. Heal the hurt 'til the hurt is gone. I'll be right where I belong, I'll be here for you. I'll be here when the sky turns gray. When the sun goes blind, the moon won't stay, I'll be the light to guide your way. On to some place new. I'll be here when the crowd is gone. When the last note fades on the very last song. I'll be the road to take you home. I'll be here for you. When your star falls from the sky and your wings don't want to fly. Just remember I'm standing by to help to see you through. 'Cause better days will come again. Clouds will break, your heart will mend. I'll be where I've always been. I'll be here for you. I'll be here when the sky turns gray.

I'll be the road to take you home. I'll be here for you. I'll be the road to take you home. I'll be here for you.	8.5
	Learning To Fly	Tom Petty				Well, I started out down a dirty road. Started out all alone. And the sun went down as I crossed the hill. And the town lit up, the world got still. I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings. Coming down is the hardest thing. Well, the good old days may not return. And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn. I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly) but I ain't got wings (Learning to fly). Coming down (Learning to fly) is the hardest thing (Learning to fly). Well, some say life will beat you down. Break your heart, steal your crown. So I've started out for God knows where. I guess I'll know when I get there. I'm learning to fly around the clouds but what goes up (Learning to fly) must come down. I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly) but I ain't got wings. Coming down is the hardest thing. I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly) around the clouds. But what goes up (Learning to fly) must come down. I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly). I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly) (Learning to fly, learning to fly).	8.6
	My Own Angel	Ankor				Another day I wake up to, to the emptiness. Once more again, I can t feel, none of this is real. All I have now is seeing you in this picture. I don t know how to go on living in the dark. I'm still loving all the times we spent sharing, side by side. And I can t get used to being oh so low, alone. It was a hard winter, there was no life in me. After your death, but then, spring came back with a secret seed. You have not left me alone. A part of you is here growing in me. I'm still loving all the times we spent sharing, yeah, side by side. And I'm starting to have some hope inside me, maybe time passes by so fast, my hope has become real. After its birth, no hurt. You've given me a life, oh a brand new life. You have not left me alone. The love we shared I see, eternally. I'm still loving all the times we spent sharing, yeah, side by side. I can even see your eyes when I look into his. Now look at him, so sure he seems. I think he feels he s never alone. He will be strong, at least I hope he has the grit to live like you, without you. He knows the steps that you took in this world and with conviction says, My own angel will guide me. My own angel guides my heart. I'm still loving all the times we spent sharing, side by side. And I feel surrounded by you when I am embracing our son. -My own angel will guide me-. Although you have gone, you will be here forever.	7.5

The leaves are already falling. Sven, it feels like the future is calling. Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee? Yeah bud, I'm really bad at planning these things out. Like candlelight and pulling of rings out. Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me. Yeah, some things never change. Like the love that I feel for her. Some things stay the same. Like how reindeers are easier. But if I commit and I go for it. I'll know what to say and do right? Some things never change. Sven, the pressure is all on you. The winds are restless. Could that be why I'm hearing this call? Is something coming? I'm not sure I want things to change at all. These days are precious. Can't let them slip away. I can't freeze this moment.

	Entre Nous	Rush				We are secrets to each other, each one's life a novel. No one else has read, even joined in bonds of love..We're linked to one another by such slender threads. We are planets to each other. Drifting in our orbits to a brief eclipse. Each of us a world apart. Alone and yet together, like two passing ships. Just between us, I think it's time for us to recognize the differences we sometimes fear to show. Just between us, I think it's time for us to realize the spaces in between. Leave room for you and I to grow. We are strangers to each other. Full of sliding panels. An illusion show acting well rehearsed routines or playing from the heart? It's hard for one to know. Just between us, I think it's time for us to recognize the differences we sometimes fear to show. Just between us, I think it's time for us to realize the spaces in between. Leave room for you and I to grow. We are islands to each other. Building hopeful bridges on a troubled sea. Some are burned or swept away, some we would not choose, but we're not always free. Just between us, I think it's time for us to recognize the differences we sometimes fear to show. Just between us, I think it's time for us to realize the spaces in between. Leave room for you and I to grow.	8
	Margaritaville	Jimmy Buffett				Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake. All of those tourists covered with oil. Strummin' my six-string on my front porch swing. Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil. Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville. Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt. Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know it's nobody's fault. Don't know the reason I stayed here all season? Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo. But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie. How it got here I haven't a clue. Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville. Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt. Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know it's nobody's fault. I blew out my flip-flop. Stepped on a pop top. Cut my heel had to cruise on back home. But there’s booze in the blender and soon it will render that frozen concoction that helps me hang on. Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville. Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt. Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know it's nobody's fault. Yes, and some people claim that there’s a woman to blame. And I know it’s my own damn fault.	8.8

The dream police, they come to me in my bed (come to me in my bed). The dream police, they're coming to arrest me, oh, no. Well, I can't tell lies 'cause they're listening to me. And when I fall asleep, bet they're spying on me tonight, tonight. 'Cause they're waiting for me. They're looking for me every single night. They're driving me insane. Those men inside my brain. I try to sleep, they're wide awake, they won't let me alone. They don't get paid to take vacations or let me alone. They spy on me, I try to hide, they won't let me alone. They persecute me, they're the judge and jury all in one. 'Cause they're waiting for me. They're looking for me every single night. They're driving me insane. Those men inside my brain. The dream police, they live inside of my head (live inside of my head). The dream police, they come to me in my bed (come to me in my bed). The dream police, they're coming to arrest me. The dream police (police, police). The dream police (police, police). The dream police (police, police). The dream police (police, police). The dream police (police, police).

	I Need Love	LL Cool J				When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call. Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove. For the first time in my life, I see I need love. There I was giggling about the games that I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names. Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn. As I said to myself, "look what you've done to her". I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels. All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal. Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true. Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you. Saying amor kissing you on the ear. Whispering, "I love you and I'll always be here". Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found. A desire for true love floating around. Inside my soul because my soul is cold. One half of me deserves to be this way 'til I'm old. But the other half needs affection and joy. And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy. I need love. I need love. Romance, sheer delight, how sweet? I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete. You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle. I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle. I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat. Kiss you on the cheek and say, "ooh girl, you're so sweet". It's deja vu whenever I'm with you. I could go on forever telling you what I do. But where you at? You're neither here or there. I swear I can't find you anywhere. Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug. This love search is really making me bug. And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen? Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean. Fantasies can run, but they can't hide. And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside. I need love. I need love. I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you. Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you. Grind, moan and never be alone. If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone. Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad. I've got money, but love's something I've never had. I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all. I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall. I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes. We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed. Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal. You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel. It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there. Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share. Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet. I swear to you this is something I'll never forget. I need love. I need love. See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer. A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger. Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration. This whole experience has been such a revelation. It's taught me love and how to be a real man. To always be considerate and do all I can. Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much. My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time. Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine. If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man. I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands. I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive. I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive. I'll search the whole world for that special girl. When I finally find you watch our love unfurl. I need love. I need love. Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall. Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love. And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting. I love you.	4.5
	Dream	Iration				You're living out there, surrounded by blue. Lush green eyes, sand on your shoes. You're home and I dream of you. Remember those times? You could make a fantasy appear in real life. Every time I leave you now I have to think twice and dream of you. And it's true, there's nowhere quite like you. It's about time that you knew. You're home and I. Dream of you I dream. Dream of you I dream. Dream of you I dream. You're home and I. When I'm lost out there, you're easy to find. I close my eyes, you're in my mind. You're home and I dream of you. December sunshine, the only memories are ones that make me feel fine. Just know we'll be together when I see you in my dream of you. And it's true, there's nowhere quite like you. It's about time that you knew. You're home and I. Dream of you I dream. Dream of you I dream. Dream of you I dream. You're home and I.	10

	Emotionally Yours	Bob Dylan				Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun. Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one. I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors, but I will always be emotionally yours. Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart. Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start. I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m livin’ for. And I will always be emotionally yours. It’s like my whole life never happened. When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought. I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it’s the only one I’ve got. Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied. Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide. I could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores, but I will always be emotionally yours.	9.5

So goodnight moon and goodnight you. When you're all that I think about, all that I dream about. How'd I ever breathe without a goodnight kiss from goodnight you?

	Let Her Cry	Hootie and The Blowfish				She sits alone by a lamp post tryin' to find the thought that's escaped her mind. She says, "Dad's the one I love the most, but Stipe's not far behind." She never lets me in, only tells me where she's been. When she's had too much to drink, I say that I don't care. I just run my hands through her dark hair, then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away. And just let her cry if the tears fall down like rain, let her sing if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be. This morning I woke up alone; found a note standing by the phone sayin', "Maybe, maybe I'll be back someday." I wanted to look for you. You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do. So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself. Sayin' let her cry if the tears fall down like rain, let her sing if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be. No, no, no, no. Let her cry, let her cry if the tears fall down like rain, let her sing if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, ah. Last night I tried to leave, cried so much I could not believe. She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago. She went in the back to get high. I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin' "Oh, mama, please help me." Won't you hold my hand and let her cry if the tears fall down like rain? Let her sing if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain, let her sing if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Ah, let her be.	6.6
	Detectorists	Johnny Flynn				Will you search through the loamy earth for me? Climb through the briar and bramble? I'll be your treasure. I felt the touch of the kings and the breath of the wind. I knew the call of all the song birds, they sang all the wrong words. I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for you. Will you swim through the briny sea for me? Roll along the ocean's floor? I'll be your treasure. I'm with the ghosts of the men who can never sing again. There's a place, follow me where a love lost at sea is waiting for you, is waiting for you.	12
	Let Me Down Easy	Gangs Of Youths				You want someone to want you for who you are. I want someone to try, then let me down easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. Honey, it’s no secret that with matters of the heart. Unreserved, I’m irrational, and rarely ever start, but since the world’s dark and often inhumane, relish our condition, come drinking in the rain. ‘Cause you remember when, after Paris, we all decided the best way to fight it was drink wine, dance here, and pray and make love that lasts with a vengeance so you can join the cowards all aboard the outrage train. You can stay afraid, or slit the throat of fear, and be brave and scratch the little itch 'til you’re moving like a motherfucker up in this bitch. You wanted to fight for a cause then go out and fall in love. Don’t stop, don’t stop believing in truth and grace in the grievance. You want someone to want you for who you are. I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. So look at me and tell me what I already know. That I trialed and I failed and it’s good to let it go. Sometimes life sucks, everything is lame. Not everything’s as easy as making lemonade. And so dismembering our state of balance with lust requited, a gaze undivided with a cool mind and warmth in your face. A good heart, a grace under pressure. You give me a good reason to be heartsick again, to be here, to be strong, to be oddly, and boldly estranged. From the loss and bitter years, I found myself descending into tedium and fear. You wanted to fight for a cause then go out and fall in love. Don’t stop, don’t stop believing in truth and grace in the grievance. You want someone to want you for who you are. I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. If it’s late, you’re drunk and wanting a reason, some reason to live. I always, I always say just put on some Whitesnake. Honey, it’s no secret that I’ve been losing my way in the weirdest of moments and the stupidest of ways. But hey, I’m still young and it’s gonna be okay. I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade. I’ll surrender then, all my balance, and be excited and drink tonight. It’s not a bad time, time spent with you. There’s cool lights and songs with good lyrics. We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you. But since you’re putting up with me, here’s another toast just to you. Let’s dance off the beat then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street. You wanted to fight for a cause then go out and love someone. Don’t stop, don’t stop believing in truth and personal freedom. I want someone to want me for who I am. I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight. Easy, easy tonight.	5.2

	Deep Inside Of You	Neil Diamond				Good morning. I love you. Now that you're here where you belong, I want to be the man you need. Just tell me you love me because I need to hear it, too. Just let me be the one you carry deep inside of you. I need you beside me; the road is so long. You run through my heart like the words of a bitter-sweet song. I'd travel the whole world, across the earth, around the sun if I could be the one you carry deep inside of you. Without you beside me, the road is so long. You live in my heart and it hurts when I think of you gone. I need you in my way. I have no right to love so true, but let me be the one. The one who lives inside of you. Just let me be the one you carry deep inside of you.	11
	The Boys of Summer:	Don Henley				Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach. I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach. Empty lake, empty streets. The sun goes down alone. I'm driving by your house though I know you're not home. But I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun. You got your hair combed back and your. Sunglasses on, baby..I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone. I never will forget those nights. I wonder if it was a dream. Remember how you made me crazy? Remember how I made you scream? Now I don't understand what happened to our love. But babe, I'm gonna get you back. I'm going to show you what I'm made of. I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun. I see you walking real slow and smiling at everyone. I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone. Out on the road today. I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac. A little voice inside my head said “Don't look back, you can never look back”. I thought I knew what love was, what did I know? Those days are gone forever. I should just let them go but I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun. You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby. I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone. I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun. You got your hair slicked back and those wayfarers on, baby. I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong. After the boys of summer have gone.	7.2

	True Love	Calvin Richardson ft. Chico Debarge				I'm always thinking of you so I thought I'd let you know. I hope I'm not intruding by telling the world I love you so. I thought I'd get to know you. What your love is about. I'm always thinking of you. 'Cause you live inside my dreams. Ohh, search the world to find your love into two. How long have I been looking for you.

	Look what you've done to me	Boz Scaggs				Hope they never end this song. This could take us all night long. I looked at the moon and I felt blue, then I looked again and I saw you. Eyes like fire in the night. Bridges burning with their light. Now I want to spend the whole night through. And Honey, Yes, I'd like to spend it all on you. Love, look what you've done to me. Never thought I'd fall again so easily. Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me. Leading me to feel this way. They might fade and turn to stone. Let's get crazy all alone. Hold me closer than you'd ever dare. Close your eyes and I'll be there. After all is said and done. After all you are the one. Take me up your stairs and through the door. Take me where we don't care anymore. Love, look what you've done to me. Never thought I'd fall again so easily. Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me would you. Leading me to feel this way. Love, look what you've done to me. Never thought I'd fall again so easily. Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me. Leading me to feel this way.	9
	Favorite Adventure	K’s Choice				There you are. Your beauty consoles me. I've gone far and I almost didn't find you. And I almost lived without you. There is nothing in this world I'd rather do than live in you. Here we go, our favorite adventure. You should know I was never more complete. And I never thought I'd see the meaning of my life wrapped in you next to me. If you ever fear someday we might lose this, come back here to this moment that will last. And time can go so fast when everything's exactly where it's at, its very best.	13
	Make me better	James blunt				You made me breakfast every morning. You made me sleep all through the night. You made me worry without any warning. Let me just lie here, drown in your eyes, dear. You made me sorry, this wasn't always. You made me hungry for your body, babe. You made me run down hospital hallways. You gave me life, dear and he has got your eyes. I waited so long, baby, I did you wrongs. Make up for the time we've wasted. You would wait by the phone. Every time I was gone, but all along. You are everything I have never been. I want you to make me better. And I've been wondering why you let me in. I want you to make me better. You made me stop and savour the moment. You made me laugh out loud, you do. You give me memories like time is frozen. You gave me a child and he's got your smile. And I sang a song every night I was gone. About all the dreams I'm chasing. And I have been wrong with the things that I've done 'cause all along. You are everything I have never been. I want you to make me better. And I've been wondering why you let me in. I want you to make me better. Although that I've never read your mind. I figured it out on my own. I am so glad that I caught you in time before I am left all alone, alone. You are everything I have never been. I want you to make me better. So please, my darling, take this wedding ring. I want you to make me better. And I've been wondering why you ever let me in. I want you to make me better. I want you to make me better. I want you to make me better.	7.3
	The Love That We've Made 	Humming House				I'll give you your dreams as best as I can and I'll clean up the dishes and the pots and the pans. I promise to hold you and I promise to dance. Oh I promise with every ounce that I have. Now I might be getting older, I might be going grey, but the years have made it clearer to me. I might loose my mind and I might fall from grace, but this love that we've made will never fade. No a life built of love will never break. Oh I'll take you to England and I'll take you to Spain. And I'll take you to places with the funniest names, but I won't take for granted everything that we have. No I promise to never do that. Now I might be getting older, I might be going grey, but the years have made it clearer to me. That even though everything we know will change, this love that we've made will never break. Now I might be getting older, I might be going grey, but the years have made it clearer to me. I might loose my mind and I might fall from grace, but this love that we've made will never fade. No a life built of love will never break.	9
	These three words	Stevie Wonder				When was the last time that they heard you say mother or father, I love you? And when was the last time that they heard you say daughter or son, I love you? Ones you say you cherish every day can instantly be taken away. Then you'd say I know this can't be true. When you never took the time to simply tell them I love you. When was the last time that they heard you say sister or brother, I love you? And when was the last time that they heard you say darling or best friend, I love you? The one for whom you'd give your very life could be taken in the twinkling of an eye. Through your tears you'd ask why did you go, knowing you didn't always show just how much you loved them so. These three words, sweet and simple. These three words, short and kind. These three words, always kindles an aching heart to smile inside. I know a family who hasn't a cent to their name, and yet the joy and love they have between them. They always claim and when one's called from life, the survived mourn the lost and will never be the same. Yet they rejoice in knowing they gave them their all. These three words, sweet and simple. These three words, short and kind. These three words, always kindles an aching heart to smile inside. These three words, sweet and simple. These three words, short and kind. These three words, always kindles an aching heart to smile inside. These three words, these three words.	7.6
	Take Thou my Hand and Lead Me	Traditional Hymn				Take Thou my hand, and lead me o'er life's rough way, with Heav'nly Manna feed me from day to day. Alone my footsteps falter and straggle wide, Lord who my life canst alter be Thou my guide. Take Thou my heart and hide it in folds of grace Though pain or woe betide it to know Thy face Draw, Lord, of Thy good pleasure Thy child to Thee, And grant me faith's full measure though naught I see. Though oft I think Thou hidest Thy wondrous might, Still to my goal Thou guidest me through dark night, Take, then, my hands and lead me till life is o'er, With heav'nly manna feed me forevermore.	13
	That's How you know its love	Deana Carter				If you get out in the drivin' rain, stand in the eye of a hurricane and never think twice. If you turn your back on selfishness and your thoughts are for someone else 'cause they've changed your life. That's how you know it's love, that's how you know it's meant to be. When the span of forever just never seems long enough, that's how you know it's love. When your heart insists that you give it all, when you no longer fear the fall and you just let it go. When the past is finally dead and gone, fate leads you somewhere to the one that has your soul. That's how you know it's love, that's how you know it's meant to be. When the span of forever just never seems long enough, that's how you know it's love. No part of you questions, no part of you doubts. You're only sure this is what loves about. And nothing and no one can stand in your way or keep you from saying what your heart is dying to say. That's how you know it's love, that's how you know it's meant to be. When the span of forever just never seems long enough, that's how you know it's love.	8.8
	A love without end amen	George Strait				I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye. Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why. When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed. And then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst. And he said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love, a secret that my daddy said was just between us." He said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then. It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen." When I became a father in the spring of '81, there was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son. And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end, I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him. And he said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love, a secret that my daddy said was just between us." He said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then. It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen." Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates. When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake. If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in. And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again. And he said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love, a secret that my daddy said was just between us." He said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then. It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen."	7.5
	OK	Backstreet boys				July, it's only been a month since I met you. I gotta say that was my favorite June. And I knew from that night that I would be alright. If I, I only knew that one day I would find someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted. Looking for the right one at the wrong door. We fit together, you make me better. Whatever it takes, I'm here forever. Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters. We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay. Baby, I'm all in it, just tell me you were all in it. People wanna talk, shut 'em all off. And tell 'em all to mind their business. Will for the grumps and cynics been that way from the beginning. People see what they don't have. They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning. Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too. Ooh, eh, eh. We fit together, you make me better. Whatever it takes, I'm here forever. Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters. We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay. Nothing else matters as long as I'm with you, I'm okay.

	Lighting Bugs and Rain 	Whiskey Myers				There's a special place nobody knows. Way up on the hill. Where the moon shines through the tall pines. And the whole damn world stands still. I'm gonna take you there where you can't be found. Put a blanket down and melt away. There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain. Girl I think I love you. Barefoot and soaking wet. You're the prettiest thing this mountain's ever seen. A picture I can't forget. With your sparkling eyes and these fireflies. A river in a frame. There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain. Never saw the view from here get any better, but you're dancing 'round the fire. Like you control the weather and here in the clouds. There's a storm on the way. There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain. There's a special place nobody knows. Way up on the hill. That's where we'll make our babies. In that cabin that we built. And we'll sit out on the porch. Just growing old, giving all the stars new names. There ain't nothing on this mountain but us, lightning bugs and rain. Lightning bugs and rain.	8.5
	Adore	Prince				Until the end of time, I'll be there for you. You own my heart and mind. I truly adore you. If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see. Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me. From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one. That night I had to call you, I was rappin' 'till the sun came up. Tellin' you just how fine you look. In a word, you were sex. All of my cool attitude you took. My body was next, you made love to me like you was afraid. Was you afraid of me? Was I the first? Was I your every fantasy? That's why until the end of time, I'll be there for you. You own my heart and mind. I truly adore you. If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see. Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me. When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds. Heavenly angels cryin' up above. Tears of joy pourin' down on us. They know we need each other, they know you are my fix. I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby. They know this is serious, I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no. This condition I got is crucial. You could say that I'm a terminal case. You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride. Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face all up in the place. I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste. A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace. Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare to your lovely face. Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening? I'm just tryin' to say that until, until the end of time, I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you. You own my heart, you own my mind. I truly adore you, I truly adore you, darlin', adore you. You don't know what you mean to me, baby. Baby, baby. Until the end of time, I'll be there for you. You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you, adore you. Can I talk to you? Tell you what you mean to me. Every time you wander, I'll be your eyes so you can see. I wanna show you things that I never showed no other, I wanna be more than your mother, more than your brother. I wanna be like no other. If you need me, I'll never leave. I know, that you know, without you there is no me, there is no me. Without you there is no sea, there is no shore. Love is too weak to define how much I adore you child, you child. The last words you hear, be with me darlin' til the end of all time, I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my mind, I'll give you my body, I'll give you my time. For all time I am with you. You are with me you are with me.	5.5
	Tears in Heaven	Eric Clapton				Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven? I must be strong and carry on. 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven. Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven? I'll find my way through night and day. 'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven. Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees, time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please. Beyond the door, there's peace I'm sure. And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven. Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven? Would you be the same if I saw you in heaven? I must be strong and carry on. 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven. 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.	10
	I will make the darkness light before thee	Charles Price Jones				I will make the darkness light before thee, what is wrong I’ll make it right before thee. All thy battles I will fight before thee. And the high place I’ll bring down. When thou walkest by the way I’ll lead thee, on the fatness of the land I’ll feed thee. And a mansion in the sky I’ll deed thee..And the high place I’ll bring down. With an everlasting love I’ll love thee, though with trials deep and sore I’ll prove thee, but there’s nothing that can hurt or move thee. And the high place I’ll bring down. When thou walkest by the way I’ll lead thee, on the fatness of the land I’ll feed thee. And a mansion in the sky I’ll deed thee..And the high place I’ll bring down.

When thou walkest by the way I’ll lead thee, on the fatness of the land I’ll feed thee. And a mansion in the sky I’ll deed thee..And the high place I’ll bring down. I will make the darkness light before thee, I will make the crooked straight before thee, I will spread my wings protecting o’er thee. And the high place I’ll bring down. When thou walkest by the way I’ll lead thee, on the fatness of the land I’ll feed thee. And a mansion in the sky I’ll deed thee..And the high place I’ll bring down.	8
	Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me	Mel Carter				Hold me, hold me and never let me go until you've told me, told me what I want to know and then just hold me, hold me, make me tell you I'm in love with you. Thrill me (thrill me), thrill me (thrill me). Walk me down the lane where shadows will be (will be) will be (will be). Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be. When you make me tell you I love you, they told me "Be sensible with your new love. Don't be fooled, thinking this is the last you'll find". But they never stood in the dark with you, love. When you take me in your arms and drive me slowly out of my mind. Kiss me (kiss me), kiss me (kiss me). And when you do, I'll know that you will miss me (miss me), miss me (miss me).

	Chances Are	Johnny Mathis				Chances are, 'cause I wear a silly grin the moment you come into view. Chances are, you think that I'm in love with you. Just because my composure sort of slips the moment that your lips meet mine. Chances are, you think my heart's your Valentine. In the magic of moonlight, when I sigh, hold me close, dear. Chances are, you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes. Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me. And if you think you could, well, chances are your chances are awfully good. Chances are, you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes. Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me. And if you think you could, well, chances are your chances are awfully good. The chances are your chances are awfully good.	10
	Here We Are	Dallas Holm				Here we are in your presence. Lifting holy hands to You. Here we are praising Jesus. For the things He's brought us through. I don't have the words to tell You how I feel, I just don't know what I can say. I'm not worthy to speak Your Holy Name, yet You tell me You love me just the same. Here we are in Your presence. Lifting holy hands to You. Here we are praising Jesus. For the things He's brought us through. I never thought that it could be this way, and I never thought I'd be the one. But You found me dying in my sin. And You looked at me with love that took me in. Here we are in Your presence. Lifting holy hands to You. Here we are praising Jesus. For the things He's brought us through. For the things He's brought us through.	10
	got to be there	Michael Jackson				Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there) in the morning when she says hello to the world. Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there).

	Key Largo	Bertie Higgins				Wrapped around each other trying so hard to stay warm. That first cold winter together lying in each other's arms. Watching those old movies falling in love so desperately. Honey, I was your hero and you were my leading lady. We had it all just like Bogie and Bacall.

	Carry On Wayward Son	Kansas				Carry on, my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more. Once I rose above the noise and confusion. Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion. I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high. Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man. Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man. I hear the voices when I'm dreaming. I can hear them say. Carry on, my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more. Masquerading as a man with a reason. My charade is the event of the season. And if I claim to be a wise man, well it surely means that I don't know. On a stormy sea of moving emotion. Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean. I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say. Carry on, my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more. Carry on, you will always remember. Carry on, nothing equals the splendor. Now your life's no longer empty, but surely heaven waits for you. Carry on, my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more. No more.	8.2
	Anniversary Song	AL Jolson				Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed. We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said. The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies. Except for the few that were there in your eyes. Dear, as I held you close in my arms, angels were singing a hymn to your charms. Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low. "Darling, I love you so". The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn. The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on. Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime. We'd find that our love is unaltered by time. Darling, I love you so. The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn. The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on. Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime. We'd find that our love is unaltered by time.	11

	Eagle When She Flies	Dolly Parton				She's been there, God knows, she's been there. She has seen and done it all. She's a woman, she knows how to dish it out or take it all. Her heart's as soft as feathers. Still she weathers stormy skies. And she's a sparrow when she's broken, but she's an eagle when she flies. A kaleidoscope of colors. You can toss her around and round. You can keep her in your vision. But you'll never keep her down. She's a lover, she's a mother. She's a friend and she's a wife. And she's a sparrow when she's broken. But she's an eagle when she flies. Gentle as the sweet magnolia. Strong as steel, her faith and pride. She's an everlasting shoulder. She's the leaning post of life. She hurts deep and when she weeps. She's just as fragile as a child and she's a sparrow when she's broken. But she's an eagle when she flies. She's a sparrow when she's broken. But she's an eagle when she flies. Oh, bless her, Lord. She's an eagle when she flies.	9.5

	It’s a great day to be alive	Travis Tritt				I got rice cookin' in the microwave. Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave. And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey I'm doin' alright. Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup. I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth. It's neither drink nor drug induced, no. I'm just doin' alright. And it's a great day to be alive.

It's been 15 years since I left home and said good luck to every seed I'd sown. Gave it my best and then I left it alone. I hope they're doin' alright. Now I look in the mirror and what do I see a lone wolf there starin' back at me. Long in the tooth but harmless as can be. Lord I guess he's doin' alright. And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin'when I close my eyes. There's some hard times in the neighborhood, but why can't everyday be just this good. Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me and the shadows that fill this room. Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'. Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh. Well I might go get me a new tattoo or take my old Harley for a three day cruise. Might even grow me a Fu Manchu. And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin'when I close my eyes. There's some hard times in the neighborhood, but why can't everyday be just this good. And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin'when I close my eyes.

	Above The Water	Moon Taxi				They never tell you everything you're gonna need to know. I barely know to swim, but I'm trying to stay afloat. Lost out here, lost out near the ocean. So unclear just where I'm going. Oh, it never lets go. It's just getting harder, but you keep my head above the water and you're pulling me along so much farther. Farther than I thought I could go. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. It's the look you give me when I'm ready to throw it in and when I think I'm at the end, you show me where to begin.

	See You Tomorrow	Muscadine Bloodline				That clock on the wall must be lying. Time flies when I'm holding you close. The night ended way too early.

	Beside You	Marianas Trench				When your tears are spent on your last pretense and your tired eyes refuse to close and sleep in your defense.

Teach me some melodious sonnet sung by flaming tongues above. Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it; mount of Thy redeeming love.

	The Rose	Conway Twitty				Some say, love, it is a river and that it drowns the tender reed. And some say, love, it's like a razor and that it leaves your soul to bleed. Some say, love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need. I say, love, it is a flower and you, it's only seed. It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance. It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance. It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give. And the soul afraid of dyin' that never learns to live. When the night has been too lonely, and the road has been too long, and you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong. Just remember, in the winter far beneath the bitter snows lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring, becomes the rose.	11
	I Do	Aloe Blacc				Thought I was good, I was good on my own, I was alright. Thought I was grown and the strangers I know, they were alright. Thought that I knew everything, never wrong, I was alright. Oh, I was good, I was good on my own, I was alright. Oh, I lived a whole life thinking I knew how my heart could handle love. A love I thought I knew. Everything before us was stretching out my heart just so it could be big enough to beat for two. Never understood why people always say "Love chooses you." Now I do. Now I do. Didn't ever think that I could ever say "I promise you" and now I do. Now I do. Now I do. This is the road, we can see where it goes together. You are my home and I know I can stay forever. Oh, I lived a whole life thinking I knew how my heart could handle love. A love I thought I knew. Everything before us was stretching out my heart just so it could be big enough to beat for two. Never understood why people always say "Love chooses you." Now I do. Now I do. Didn't ever think that I could ever say "I promise you" and now I do. Now I do. Now I do, I do. Now I do, I do. Used to be a time when I thought that I had nothing to lose, but now I do. Now I do. Never understood why people always say "Love chooses you." Now I do (Now I do). Now I do (Now I do). Didn't ever think that I could ever say "I promise you" and now I do. Now I do. Now I do, I do. Now I do, I do.	7.4
	By My Side 	Ben Harper				Don't you get ahead of me and I won't leave you behind. If you get unhappy, won't you show me a sign? There's no love like lost love.m, no pain like a broken heart. There's no love like you and me and no loss like us apart. Promises, promise is only a word. And when softly spoken is never heard. And a heart is not a stone and is fragile, is fragile when alone. By my side, by my side. Won't you be by my side, by my side, by my side? Won't you be by my side? My care for you is from the ground up to the sky. It's over under up above, down below and to the side. There's no use in pretending, no use in saving face. For my love is never ending and you are my saving grace. By my side, by my side. Won't you be by my side? By my side, by my side. Won't you be by my side?	10
	Sister Oh Sister 	Rosanne Cash				Sister, oh, sister. I miss your shadow, I miss your shade. When I was afraid, you pulled me through. Sister, big sister. You set the standard, you set the curve. You showed the nerve. When I needed you, those old Pennebaker boys stop making all that noise. And you beat 'em to the dirt without blinking. My fists flew in the air 'cause I knew that you'd be there to grab 'em by the shirt without thinking. Sister, oh, sister. The whole house in shambles. You stood straight as a bean, you made a whole team. Out of me and you. A time we stole a car. You tried to sneak me in a bar when I was barely twelve and you were fourteen. Cross that parking lot expanse on those oyster shells we dance. Whilst some cowboy watched you twisting through the porch screen. Sister, oh, sister. You been my sea wall, you been my blood. You're in my blood. I thank God for you.	9.5
	"I'll Back You Up	Dave Matthews Band"				I remember thinking I'll go on forever only knowing I'll see you again. But I know the touch of you is so hard to remember. But like that touch I know no other and for sure we have danced in the risk of each other. Would like to dance around the world with me. I'll be falling all about my own thing and I know your the heaviest weight. When your not here that's hung around my head. And your lips burn wild. Thrown from the face of a child. And in your eyes, the seeing of the greatest few. Do what you will, always. Walk where you like, your steps. Do as you please, I'll back you up. I remember thinking. Sometimes we walk, sometimes we run away. But I know no matter how fast we are running, somehow we keep, somehow we keep up with each other. I'll be falling all about my own thing and I know your the heaviest weight. When your not here that's hung around my head. And your lips burn wild. Thrown from the face of a child. And in your eyes, the seeing of the greatest few. Do what you will, always. Walk where you like, your steps. Do as you please, I'll back you up.	8.5
	455 rocket 	kathy mattea				Mr. Smith had an Oldsmobile. Baby blue with them wire wheels. I took her home the day that she was advertised. He said she leaked when it would rain. Sounded like an aeroplane, but I knew she was jewel in disguise. She had a 455 rocket. The biggest block alive. Couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn. She was made for the straight aways. She grew up hating Chevrolets. She's a rocket. She was made to burn. Well, whose junk pile piece of Chevelle is this? You boys come here to race or just kiss? Mmm, now don't ya want to know what I got underneath my hood? I know she might sound like she's missin', but buddy, she could teach you a lesson. In just a quarter mile, and I'll smoke you good. In my 455 rocket. The kind the police drive. I couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn. She was made for the straight aways. She grew up hating Chevrolets. She's a rocket. She was made to burn. I'm telling you and I ain't ashamed. I cried when that wrecker came as we skid I thought I heard the angels sing. Sounded like the Beach Boys. We hit the curb and began to sail. Took out most of the safety rail. Even the cop asked me, "Man what'd you have in that thing?" I had a 455 rocket. The very kind you drive. You oughta watch yourself when you take that turn. She was made for the straight aways. She grew up hating Chevrolets. She's a rocket, she was made to burn, burn. Oh she's a rocket, she was made to burn.	7.5

	All These Things	The Uniques				The touch of your lips next to mine gets me excited, makes me feel fine. The touch of your hand, your sweet hello. The fire inside you when you're holding me close. Your love, so warm and tender. The thrill is so divine. It is all these things that make you mine. If you would leave, I surely would die. When you were ten minutes late, I started to cry. I've got it bad, it's alright as long as you're here every night. Your love, so warm and tender. The thrill is so divine. It is all these things that make you mine.	13
	Only To Be With You	Judah and The Lion				And all of the cities and places I've seen, and all of the people and miles in between, I would trade only to be with you. And all of the sunsets and days on the oceans, reflections of stars on the top of the mountains, I'd give it all away only to be with you. And oh, my love, you know I would if I thought that I could. I'd add it all up and give it all away only to be with you. All of my words and the melodies that hold them and all of the notes that are placed and wrapped in these strings only to be with you. And all of my dreams and the things that come true, I've looked at my future and all that I've wanted to do only to be with you. And oh, my love, you know I would if I thought that I could. I'd add it all up and give it all away only to be with you. And oh, my love, you know I would if I thought that I could. I'd add it all up and give it all away only to be with you, only to be with you, only to be with you.	10
	Making love out of nothing at all	air supply				I know just how to whisper and I know just how to cry. I know just where to find the answers and I know just how to lie. I know just how to fake it and I know just how to scheme. I know just when to face the truth and then I know just when to dream. And I know just where to touch you and I know just what to prove. I know when to pull you closer and I know when to let you loose. And I know the night is fading and I know the time's gonna fly. And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you, but I know I gotta give it a try. And I know the roads to riches and I know the ways to fame. I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em and I always know the name of the game. But I don't know how to leave you and I'll never let you fall. And I don't know how you do it. Making love out of nothing at all. (Making love) Out of nothing at all. (Making love) Out of nothing at all. (Making love) Out of nothing at all. (Making love) Out of nothing at all.

And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight. The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost and it's looking for a rhythm like you. You can take the darkness from the pit of the night and turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright. I've gotta follow it cause everything I know. Well it's nothing till I give it to you. I can make the runner stumble. I can make the final block and I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle. I can make all the stadiums rock. I can make tonight forever or I can make it disappear by the dawn. And I can make you every promise that has ever been made. And I can make all your demons be gone. But I'm never gonna make it without you. Do you really wanna see me crawl? And I'm never gonna make it like you do. Making love out of nothing at all. (Making love) Out of nothing at all.

	I Stand With You 	The Dawn (IND)				Midnight eyes, chasing shadows through the night. Dismal cries, painting skies with flames in flight. In a house of sorrow, in a house of pain, I was left out, kicked out in the rain. Questions to reason. Though nothing else remains. Questions to reason. Though nothing else remains. One wish to ask a vision to last..Set me free. Icarus flights into the sea. Though no else will see, nothing left for sympathy. A million flights to crash like a silent scream of humble dreams to be. Here I stand with you.	13
	Pieces of April	Three Dog Night				April gave us springtime and the promise of the flowers. And the feeling that we both shared and the love that we called ours. We knew no time for sadness, that's a road we each had crossed. We were living a time meant for us, and even when it would rain, we would laugh it off. I've got pieces of April, I keep them in a memory bouquet. I've got pieces of April, it's a morning in May. We stood on the crest of summer, beneath an oak that blossomed green. Feeling as I did in April, not really knowing what it means. But it must be then that you stand beside me now to make me feel this way. Just as I did in April, but it's a morning in May. I've got pieces of April, I keep them in a memory bouquet. I've got pieces of April, but it's a morning in May. I've got pieces of April, I keep them in a memory bouquet. I've got pieces of April, but it's a morning in May.	
	Hear Me Now	Bad Wolves				I'm at the bottom, can you come let me up. 'Cause I wrote a vow for you. Your friends are faded, let me fill up your cup and toast to the stars over. The ocean's foaming emotions in the air. I don't wanna live for nothing. Just wanna be something. I never knew what it took to win. I don't wanna live for nothing. Just wanna be something. I never knew we'd be more than friends. We spin the bottle till we're kissing our cups. Felt like I'd die for you. You can't explain it, it's been years since we've touched and I've waited nine for you. I don't wanna live for nothing. Just wanna be something. I never knew what it took to win. I don't wanna live for nothing. Just wanna be something. I never knew we'd be more than friends. Come let me up. Can you hear me now? I'm bout half a block away out. Can you hear me now? The ocean's foaming emotions in the air. I don't wanna live for nothing. Just wanna be something. I never knew what it took to win. I don't wanna live for nothing. Just wanna be something. I never knew we'd be more than friends. Come let me up. Can you hear me now? Come let me up. I'm bout half a block away out. Come let me up. Can you hear me now? Come let me up.

	Because We Are in Love (The Wedding Song) l	the Carpenters				Children. It was more fun to be children. We just took life as it happened. Run thru the days, don't look behind. Over wink of an eye and it's over. What a surprise to discover, we were people ourselves. What kind of people did we want to be. No answer ever came to me. It didn't sleep at all last night. Mom, I've come to you like yesterday. About today. Mom, I'm afraid. Hon, come and sit by my side, listen to me. Words come so hard, but what my heart says I will give you. Because you are in love, your eyes begin to open as if you had awaken from a sleep. Because you are in love, you use imagination and lose your concentration. When someone drops his name, you're back in his arms as always. Your day-dreams work out that way. It's all just a trick you mind plays. The more love grows, the more it says the same. (Same little girl who's frightened) But I love him so (Same little girl who's sure) that she loves him so (Sees with a woman's vision knows what a woman knows). Because we are in love, we reach for our tomorrows and know we won't be lonely. In laughter and in sorrows, where love abides. There is the place we'll keep our love forever. You and I. Because we are in love. When love abides, there is the place we'll keep our home forever. You and I. Beacuse we are in love.	8
	Cycles 	frank sinatra				So I'm down and so I'm out, but so are many others. So I feel like tryin' to hide. My head 'neath these covers. Life is like the seasons. After winter comes the spring. So I'll keep this smile awhile and see what tomorrow brings. I've been told and I believe that life is meant for livin'. And even when my chips are low, there's still some left for givin'. I've been many places. Maybe not as far as you. So I think I'll stay awhile and see if some dreams come true. There isn't much that I have learned through all my foolish years. Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles. First there's laughter, then those tears. But I'll keep my head up high. Although I'm kinda tired. My gal just up and left last week. Friday I got fired. You know it's almost funny, but things can't get worse than now. So I'll keep on tryin' to sing. But please, just don't ask me how.	10
	Baby I’m-a Want You	Bread				Baby, I'm a want you. Baby, I'm a need you. You're the only one I care enough to hurt about. Maybe I'm a crazy, but I just can't live with out. Your lovin' and affection, givin' me direction. Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour. Lately, I'm a prayin' that you'll always be stayin' beside me. Used to be my life was just emotions passing by. Feeling all the while and never really knowing why. Lately, I'm a prayin' that you'll always be stayin' beside me. Used to be my life was just emotions passing by. Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry. You taught me why. Baby, I'm a want you. Baby, I'm a need you. Ooh, took so long to find you, baby. Baby, I'm a want you. Baby, I'm a need you.	10
	I’d do anything for you	jake Owen				Box of sunshine, bottle of rain. Fistful of wind from a West Texas plain. Tell me you want it, baby, that's all you've gotta do. I'll do anything for you. I'd walk the Mississippi, I'd drown in your kiss. Catch a star in a mason jar so you could make your wish. Whatever that may be, baby, I'll make it come true. I'll do anything for you. You are the reason I live my religion. The air that I breathe, you're that deep in me. And I'll give you my heart and my soul. There's no fire I wouldn't walk through, oh I'll do anything for you. I'd call on the nightingale to write you a song. I'll sing you to sleep, baby, and I'll wake you at dawn. I'll wrap you in sweet dreams the whole night through. I'll do anything for you. You are the reason I live my religion. The air that I breathe, you're that deep in me. And I'll give you my heart and my soul. There's no fire I wouldn't walk through, oh I'll do anything for you. In the shadows of the last sunset. I'll bargain with God and say take me instead. After all, baby, it's the least I can do. I'll do anything for you, I'd do anything for you.	9
	Waste	Phish				Don't want to be an actor pretending on the stage. Don't want to be a writer with my thoughts out on the page. Don't want to be a painter 'cause everyone comes to look. Don't want to be anything where my life's an open book. A dream it's true but I'd see it through if I could be wasting my time with you. Don't want to be a farmer working in the sun. Don't want to be an outlaw always on the run. Don't want to be a climber reaching for the top. Don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop. A dream it's true, but I'd see it through if I could be wasting my time with you. So if I'm inside your head, don't believe what you might have read. You'll see what I might have said to hear it. Come waste your time with me. Come waste your time with me. So if I'm inside your head, don't believe what you might have read. You'll see what I might have said to hear it. Come waste your time with me. Come waste your time with me. Come waste your time with me. Come waste your time with me. Come waste your time with me.	9
	Spin you around	Morgan Wallen				I've been lookin' at you from across the room. 'Bout time I got my nerve. Well you might tell me "Boy hell naw". But hell what can it hurt? 'Cause I just wanna spin you around, around this dance floor. Get you drunk on a love like mine. Might wind up and steal a couple kisses. Get your digits if I can find the right line. And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'. I'ma do my best to change your mind. 'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign. Girl it oughta be a crime. Got a pretty good feelin' I'm takin' you home. Gonna love you with all I got. But before we slip out into the night, I just want one more shot. To take your hand and spin you around, around this dance floor. Get you drunk on a love like mine. Might wind up and steal a couple kisses. Get your digits if I can find the right line.

Get you drunk on a love like mine. Might wind up and steal a couple kisses. Get your digits if I can find the right line. And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'.

	last first kiss					I dressed to the nines, I thought I’d be getting lucky that night, but I never prepared to see the most beautiful thing in my life. She had her blue dress with her favorite high heels on. The way she twirled around, the way she sang along. To see a smile on her face, first time going to prom. We had no idea tonight would be the night we’d fall in love. Maybe it was fate that brought you to me. Whatever it was, I thank God everyday. Cuz I rarely believe in fantasy. You’re too good to be true, girl I’ve loved you since, you were my last first kiss. If you’re so wrong then I don’t wanna be so right. Cuz our love is a candle that burns all through the night. Just say the words, I'll jump, I don't care if I can't fly. Cuz I've never fallen deeper than that time. Maybe it was fate that brought you to me. Whatever it was, I thank God everyday. Cuz I rarely believe in fantasy. You’re too good to be true, girl I’ve loved you since, you were my last first kiss.	9

	 hey Girl	OAR				I took this girl out last night and we left around twelve. We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves. I like to read, she likes to write. She likes to sleep and I love to stay up all night. My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree. But that's OK, that the way I like to be. Hey girl come with me and let yourself go. Hey girl come with me and let yourself go. We went out late last night and we danced through the night. I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight, she was.

Hey girl come with me and let yourself go. Hey girl come with me and let yourself go. Just let yourself go. Hush little baby don't say a word. I'd like to give you everything that you deserve. I'll give you my heart, give you all my soul. You can ask for my money. If you like you can have control. In my mind, I miss you every night that you're not here. Oh, I just want to sit around your life and breathe your air. And if i cannot have you, I just don't want to live. Oh I got so much I'd like to give. Hey girl come with me and let yourself go.

	Stars Fell On Alabama 	ella Fitzgerald				We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white. And stars fell on Alabama last night. I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light. And stars fell on Alabama last night. I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly. A fairy land where no one else could enter. And in the center, just you and me. My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight. And stars fell on Alabama last night. I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly.

	"I love you will still sound the same	Oh honey				Could you see yourself growing old with me? Watching my head turn to grey? Could you live with me in my mistakes and the ones I have yet to make? So when our eyes have seen their better days and our hearing starts to fade, put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest. "I love you" will still sound the same. "I love you" will still sound the same. Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey. Hey yeah ey ey yeah. Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey. "I love you" will still sound the same. "I love you" will still sound the same.

	Back On My Feet Again	the babys				I was so lonely until I met you. Told myself I'd get by without love. Drownin' my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows. Kind of felt that I just had enough. You light up my face with your jokes and your smiles. And the way that you came every night. Don't know what you got, but I'm sure glad I found you. Could be wrong but it sure feels right. And here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Surprised at myself for the way that I feel. So happy that you're here with me. Some women I've known, have left me with nothing. But I guess that was just meant to be. And here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. I was down for the count. I was down, I was beat, I was cryin'. I was cornered and hurt. I was hidin' my face, sick of tryin'. I was so lonely until I met you. Told myself I'd get by without love. Drowning my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows. Kind of felt that I just had enough. And here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Yeah, here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Oh yeah. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again. Here I am, I'm back on my feet again.	8
	Monsoon Cloud	Trevor Hall				Rain it be falling from a monsoon cloud. All of that water coming out of your mouth. What did we see, where did we go? Darling, will we ever, ever really know?

	Love is a wild thing	Kacey Musgraves				You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store. If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more. Even if you lose it, it will find you. There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to. Running like a river tryna find the ocean. Flowers in the concrete. Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows. Places that you can't see. Coming through the melody when the night bird sings. Love is a wild thing. Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips. And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips. Even if you lose me, I will find you. There's no way to stop it, so don't try to. Running like a river tryna find the ocean. Flowers in the concrete. Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows. Places that you can't see. Coming through the melody when the night bird sings. Love is a wild thing. I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark. But not anymore, anymore, no. Running like a river tryna find the ocean. Flowers in the concrete. Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows. Places that you can't see. Coming through the melody when the night bird sings. Love is a wild thing. Love is a wild thing. Love is a wild thing, yeah.	8.2
	This is Ours	Bumpin Uglies 				Rainfall sings a song upon the roof. Half asleep in bed and I'm dreaming of my youth. When my biggest fear was ending up alone. Family is an obsession when you're from a broken home. Now I rome, I'm always on the move. But when I'm here with you there's never anything to prove. Effortless and simple, loving you is easy. All you ask is to be held at night before you fall asleep. And no one else will have this cause no one else will be us. This lives and dies with you and I. This is unique And it is ours. It's an hour before sunrise and you are still asleep. I'm lost inside the song that you are breathing next to me. It's drowning out the voices that live inside my head. The world seems to stand still when lovers share their bed. And I have said everything words can convey. But language fails to get across exactly. What the heart would say I hope you know. I'm yours and our story will unfold. While we make a couple babies and watch while they grow old.	9.2

On this day, as you join in heart and spirit, you begin another chapter in the book of life. Love is the circle that surrounds you. You can find it on the faces of your family & friends. Love let it wrap it's arms around you. And guide you on your journey down the road that never ends. There's a song in your heart you can hear it if you listen. As whispers through the branches high above the family tree. And there's time. Lay it's melody upon you. You can rest assured in knowing that you're right where you should be. Love is the circle that surrounds you. You can find it on the faces of your family & friends. Love let it wrap it's arms around you. And guide you on your journey down the road that never ends.	10
	It was me	jamey johnson				The first time I met her, she walked right up to me and said "You're who I've wanted to find". There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me. She said, "I can't believe it 'cause I've never been in here and I've passed this place so many times". It was her night to find destiny and it was me. And we danced to every song that they played and talked until closin' time. The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine. The I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar. Lookin' back when I looked in her eyes. The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me. And we danced to every song that they played and talked until closin' time. The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine. She wasn't lookin', and I wasn't lookin'. Ain't it funny, that that's when love was found. She still calls it her lucky night. Yeah, someone was lucky, she's right, but it was me. Aw, it was me.	9.2

Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear, ooh, ooh, fuck the world damn straight malaise. It may be just us who feel this way, but don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction. My love, you're the one I want to watch the ship go down with. The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is unless we're naked getting high on the mattress while the global market crashes.

	I Got You	Ward Davis				Well, I ain't never took a sniff of cocaine or shot no heroin in my veins, and I only eat pills the doctor tells me too. But I'd be lyin' if I said that I won't sip a little scotch or take a little toke, but not near as much as I used too. 'Cause I got you and the taste of your love is all the trip I need. I got you and I'd have to be a fool to mess with reality. Everybody likes to have a little vice or two and I got you. Well, I ain't never seen the ruins of Rome or black sand beaches of Mexico, and I doubt if I'll ever set foot on the moon. Well, none of that sounds that good to me. Whereever you are, that's where I'll be. There ain't no reason to go and change my view when I got you and the taste of your love is all the trip I need. I got you and I'd have to be a fool to mess with reality. What is there to see in Malibu when I got you? I got you and the taste of your love is all the trip I need. Yeah, I got you and I'd have to be a fool to mess with reality. There's no place I wanna go, or drug to do. And I got you.	9
	I'll Be There For You	Bon Jovi				I guess this time you're really leaving. I heard your suitcase say goodbye. Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding, you say true love is suicide. You say you've cried a thousand rivers, and now you're swimming for the shore. You left me drowning in my tears, and you won't save me anymore. I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'd steal the sun from the sky for you. Words can't say what love can do. I'll be there for you. I know you know we've had some good times. Now they have their own hiding place. Well, I can promise you tomorrow, but I can't buy back yesterday. And, baby, you know my hands are dirty, but I wanted to be your Valentine. I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby. When you get drunk, I'll be the wine. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'd steal the sun from the sky for you. Words can't say what love can do. I'll be there for you. I wasn't there when you were happy, and I wasn't there when you were down. I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby. I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'd steal the sun from the sky for you.

	If I Didn't Have You	Randy Newman				If I were a rich man with a million or two, I'd live in a penthouse in a room with a view. And if I were handsome, it could happen. Those dreams do come true. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you. Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have. Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have. Wouldn't have nothing. For years, I have envied (you're green with it) your grace and your charm. Everyone loves you, you know. Yes, I know, I know, I know, but I must admit it. Big guy, you always come through. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you. You and me together, that's how it always should be. One without the other don't mean nothing to me, nothing to me. Yes, I wouldn't be nothing if I didn't have you to serve. I'm just a punky little eyeball and a funky optic nerve. Hey, I never told you this, but sometimes I get a little blue, but I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you. Dance with me. I wouldn't be nothing if I didn't have you. I wouldn't know where to go, wouldn't know what to do. I don't have to say it 'cause we both know it's true. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you. I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you.	8
	Gone Too Soon	Andrew Jannakos				Every night at twelve o'clock on the dot, it never fails. You call me up talkin' 'bout you had a bad day, so you're pullin' up. So, I pour up a cup of just what you need 'cause I know what you need. I love it when you wanna sleep at my place. I love it when we dancin' down the hallway, but when you leave, it puts me in a bad place. Will you stay? Come on, please stay. You come around unannounced, and you leave with the sunlight. Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with a "goodbye." Same thing every night, I can never get enough time. I want more of ya. I want more of that. Moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine (It's gone too soon). Your silhouette, your fingertips, you're lingerin'. You ain't goin' nowhere. My t-shirt, you're still in it. Been on your phone for a minute. Baby, who you kiddin'? Girl, we're runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' from the truth. I know you want me too. So, why do you? You come around unannounced, and you leave with the sunlight. Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with a "goodbye." Same thing every night, I can never get enough time. I want more of ya. I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine (It's gone too soon). Yeah, it's gone too soon. It's gone too soon. Girl, we're runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' from the truth, but we don't have to. So, you don't have to. Come around unannounced, and you leave with the sunlight. Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with a "goodbye." Same thing every night, I can never get enough time. I want more of ya. I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine (It's gone too soon). It's gone too soon, gone too soon.	7
	For Your Love	Stevie Wonder				All the gold in all the world is nothing to possess if all the things that it can bring can't add up to one ounce of your happiness. And for your love, I would do anything just to see the smile upon your face. For your love, I would go anywhere just you tell me and I'll be right there. A diamond that shines like a star in the sky is nothing to behold. For minuscule is any light, if it can't, like you, brighten up my soul. And for your love, I would do anything just to see the smile upon your face. For your love, I would go anywhere just you tell me and I'll be right there (oh yeah, oh yeah). I could have never fathomed this such joy, love, and tenderness that you give to me. For the love I feel inside, it's so wonderful I can't hide and I glow, I glow with just the thought of you. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. And for your love, I would do anything just to see the smile upon your face. For your love, I would go anywhere just you tell me and I'll be right there one more time. And for your love, I would do anything just to see the smile upon your face. For your love, I would go anywhere just you tell me and I'll, I'll be right there, yeah, one more, one more time. And for your love, I would do anything just to see the smile upon your face. For your love, I would go anywhere just you tell me and I'll be right there (I'll be right there, I'll be right there).	8
	Weekend in New England	Barry Manilow				Last night I wave goodbye. Now its seems years. I'm back in the city where nothing is clear. But thoughts of me holding you, bringing us near. And tell me when will our eyes meet? When can I touch you? When will this strong yearning end and when will I hold you again? Time in New England took me away to long rocky beaches and you by the bay. We started a story who's end must now wait. And tell me when will our eyes meet? When can I touch you? When will this strong yearning end and when will I hold you again? I feel the change coming. I feel the wind blow. I feel brave and daring. I feel my blood flow. With you I could bring out all the love that I have. With you there's a heaven so earth ain't so bad. And tell me when will our eyes meet? When can I touch you? When will this strong yearning end and when will I hold you again?	10
	Brooklyn Bridge	Lee DeWyze				Things like this don't happen to me. Everything used to be so ordinary. From the day that I met you, everything's changed. Feel like Im dreaming with my eyes open wide. Baby you make me feel so good inside. What you've done to me is kinda hard to explain. Like standin' in Times Square on New Year's Eve and no one is around. Like lookin up on a summer's day and seein' snowflakes fallin' down. Like danicin' on the Brooklyn bridge by perfect candlelight. That's how you make me feel every time you say you're mine. Mmm Mm. It seems like just yesterday that I didn't even know your name. And now I cant imagine life without you here, my dear. What you do to me, it's something new to me, yeah. All I'm tryin to say is every time you're near. It's like standin' in Times Square on New Year's Eve and no one is around. Like lookin up on a summer's day and seein' snowflakes fallin' down. Like danicin' on the Brooklyn bridge by perfect candlelight. That's how you make me feel every time you say you're mine. Mmmm. And everyday it feels like Im falling in love with you again. It gets better every time. And the lights of the city they fall all around me. They cant make me feel like this. Cuz nothing compares to dancing with you on the brooklyn bridge. Mmm Mmm Mmm. It's like standin' in Times Square on New Year's Eve and no one is around. Like lookin up on a summer's day and seein' snowflakes fallin' down. Like danicin' on the Brooklyn bridge by perfect candlelight. That's how you make me feel every time you say you're mine. Mmm Mm.	7
	 Breathless	Shayne Ward in the background				If our love was a fairy tale, I would charge in and rescue you. On a yacht baby we would sail to an island where we'd say I do. And if we had babies they would look like you, it'd be so beautiful if that came true. You don't even know how very special you are. You leave me breathless. You're everything good in my life. You leave me breathless. I still can't believe that you're mine. You just walked out of one of my dreams. So beautiful you're leaving me breathless. And if our love was a story book, we would meet on the very first page. The last chapter would be about how I'm thankful for the life we've made. And if we had babies they would have your eyes, I would fall deeper watching you give life. You don't even know how very special you are. You leave me breathless. You're everything good in my life. You leave me breathless. I still can't believe that you're mine. You just walked out of one of my dreams. So beautiful you're leaving me. You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me. You're like an angel. The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me. You're something special. I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me, but all I can do is try every day of my life. You leave me breathless. You're everything good in my life. You leave me breathless. I still can't believe that you're mine. You just walked out of one of my dreams. So beautiful you're leaving me breathless. You leave me breathless. You're everything good in my life. You leave me breathless. I still can't believe that you're mine. You just walked out of one of my dreams. So beautiful you're leaving me breathless.	7
	A little more country than that	Easton Corbin				Imagine a dirt road full of potholes. With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat. I'm a little more country than that. Picture a small town with an old hound. Laying out front of the courthouse. While the old men chew the fat. I'm a little more country than that. I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat. 'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back. I'm a little more country than that. Think of a Hank song from days gone. With a steel rod that's so strong, sends chills up your back. I'm a little more country than that. If you want a brick home in a school zone. With the doors locked and alarms on..Girl, you're way off track. I'm a little more country than that. I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat. 'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back. I'm a little more country than that. Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from lovers but they fell flat, but this ring ain't something that I mean to give you and then take back. I'm a little more country than that. I'm a little more country than that. I'm a little more country than that.	8
	She's Got a Way With Me	Billy Currington				It's a gentle touch, but more than enough. She can stop this ole world from spinnin' too much. It's a natural thing and I do believe I found my reason to be. She's got a way with me, she's got a way with me. I'm not the same man since she's been around. There's more to this life, I've suddenly found. I look at myself now so differently. It's her love that brings me peace. She's got a way with me, she's got a way with me. Whatever it is, I'll always be under her spell. She'll always be all I'll ever need. I could search the whole world and I know I'd never find someone perfect as her for me. Suddenly it's something you just can't live without. Oh, you know you found love beyond any doubt. With a simple man's words I can never convey all that I feel when I say. She's got a way with me, she's got a way with me, she's got a way with me. (She's got a way with me)	10
	In case you don’t live forever	Ben Platt				You put all your faith in my dreams. You gave me the world that I wanted. What did I do to deserve you? I follow your steps with my feet. I walk on the road that you started. I need you to know that I heard you, every word. I've waited way too long to say everything you mean to me. In case you don’t live forever, let me tell you now. I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around. In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth. I’m everything that I am because of you. I, I've carried this song in my mind. Listen, it's echoing in me but I haven't helped you to hear it. We, we've only got so much time. I'm pretty sure it would kill me. If you didn't know the pieces of me are pieces of you. I've waited way too long to say everything you mean to me. In case you don’t live forever, let me tell you now. I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around. In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth. I’m everything that I am because of you. I have a hero whenever I need one. I just look up to you and I see one. I'm a man 'cause you taught me to be one. In case you don’t live forever, let me tell you now. I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around. In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth. I’m everything that I am because of you. Whoa, whoa. In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth. As long as I'm here as I am, so are you.	7.5
	Everywhere	Fleetwood Mac				Calling out your name, calling out your name. Can you hear me calling out your name? You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say. I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout. You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere (I wanna be with you everywhere). Something's happening, happening to me. My friends say I'm acting peculiarly. Come along, baby, we better make a start. You better make it soon before you break my heart. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere (I wanna be with you everywhere). Can you hear me calling out your name? You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say. Come along, baby, we better make a start. You better make it soon before you break my heart. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere. Oh I, I wanna be with you everywhere. (I wanna be with you everywhere)	8.8
	Gangsta's Paradise	Coolio				As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left. ‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that even my momma thinks that my mind is gone. But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it. Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of. You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin' or you and your homies might be lined in chalk. I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc. As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke. Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like. On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight. Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Look at the situation they got me facin'. I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street. So I gotta be down with the hood team. Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams. I'm a educated fool with money on my mind. Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye. I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger. And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger. Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away. I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say? I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24? The way things is goin' I don't know. Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me? Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Power and the money, money and the power. Minute after minute, hour after hour. Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'. It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'. They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me. If they can't understand it, how can they reach me? I guess they can't, I guess they won't. I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool! Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise. Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me? Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me?	5.5
	Happily Ever After	Case				Guess what I did today. Those were the words I said to you. It was last may, dont know the exact day. In my hand there was a ring. Then you told me that you loved me more than anything in your life. So I asked you would you do me the honor of being my wife. Yes I will, I will be your man. Your protector, your best friend. Till my humble life is ended and time begins again, couldn't we be. Couldn't we be happily ever after? We could be strong together for so long. My love is oh so strong. Couldn't we be happily ever after? Couldn't we be? Leaving you never till forever's gone. When I was away, mmm, mmm. Some friends became just faces. Some people grew apart, but you stayed right in my heart. And so many times pictured this day inside my mind. And for so many years, ooh, I knew it would be you here with me, oh. Yes I will take you for my wife. The center of my life. And I will never, ever fade from this choice I made, oh. Couldn't we be happily ever after? We could be strong together for so long. My love is oh so strong. Couldn't we be happily ever after? Couldn't we be? Leaving you never till forever's gone. No no. Hey yeag. You don't have to look no further than me. Don't look no more, baby yeah. You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy. I'm so happy, I'm so happy babe. Beneath the sight of God, I will make this vow to you, come on baby. I'll be right here, stay with me. Said I'll be here, baby hey. Couldn't we be happily ever after. I said I wanna be, I said I wanna be. We could be strong together for so long. Couldn't we be happily ever after. Couldn't we be, babe? Leaving you never till forever's gone. No, no I will never leave you, ooh. Couldn't we be happily ever after. See today, I wanna make you my wife.	6.4
	We will dance	Steven Curtis Chapman				I've watched the sun rise in your eyes and I've seen the tears fall like the rain. You've seen me fight so brave and strong. You've held my hand when I'm afraid. We've watched the seasons come and go. We'll see them come and go again, but in winter's chill or summer's breeze, one thing will not be changing. We will dance when the sun is shining, in the pouring rain. We'll spin and we'll sway and we will dance. When the gentle breeze becomes a hurricane, the music will play. And I'll take your hand and hold you close to me and we will dance. Sometimes it's hard to hold you tight. Sometimes we feel so far apart. Sometimes we dance as one. And feel the beating of each other's heart. Some days the dance is slow and sweet. Some days we're bouncing off the walls. But no matter how this world may turn, our love will keep us from falling and. We will dance when the sun is shining, in the pouring rain. We'll spin and we'll sway and we will dance. When the gentle breeze becomes a hurricane, the music will play. And I'll take your hand and hold you close to me and we will dance. The music will play and I'll hold you close and I won't let go. Even when our steps grow weak and slow. Still I'll take your hand and hold you close to me and we will dance.	8
	Honey and the Bee	Owl City				Don't remind me that some days I'm a windshield and other days I'm just a lucky bug. As cold iron rails leave, old mossy trails through the countryside. The crow and the bean field are my best friends but boy, I need a hug (boy, I need a hug). 'Cause my heart stops without you, there's something about you that makes me feel alive. If the green left the grass on the other side, I would make like a tree and leave. But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide? Who knew the other side could be so green? Don't remind me, I'm a chickadee in love with the sky. But that's clearly not a lot to crow about. 'Cause when the stars silhouette me, I'm scared they'll forget me and flicker out. I taste honey but I haven't seen the hive. Yeah I didn't look, I didn't even try. But still my heart stops without you 'cause there's something about you that makes me feel alive. If the green left the grass on the other side, I would make like a tree and leave. But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide? Who knew the other side could be so green? We are honey and the bee. Backyard of butterflies surrounded me. I fell in love with you like bees to honey. So let's up and leave the weeping to the willow tree. And pour our tears in the sea. I swear there's a lot of vegetables out there that crop up for air. And yet I never thought. We were two peas in a pod until you suddenly bloomed. Then I knew that I'd always love you. Oh, I'll always love you too. If the green left the grass on the other side, I would make like a tree and leave. But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide? Who knew the other side could be so green? If the green left the grass on the other side, I would make like a tree and leave. But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide? Who knew the other side could be so green? And if I reached for your hand for the rest of my life, who knew the other side could be so green?	6.2
	Summer Wages	Nanci Griffith				Never hit seventeen. When you play against the dealer, you know that the odds won't ride with you. Never leave your woman alone with your friends around to steal her. She'll be gambled and gone like summer wages. And we'll keep rollin on till we get to Vancouver. And the lady that I love. Shes living there. It's been six long months and more since I've seen her. Maybe she's gambled and gone. Like summer wages. In all the beer parlors. All down along Main Street. The dreams of the season are spilled down on the floor. All the big stands of timber. Wait there just for fallin'. The hookers standing watchfully waitin' by the door. I'm going to work on them towboats with my slippery city shoes. Lord I swore I would never do that again. Through the great fog bound straights. Where the cedars stand waitin. I'll be lost and gone like summer wages. In all the beer parlors. All down along Main Street. The dreams of the season are spilled down on the floor..All the big stands of timber. Wait there just for fallin'..The hookers waiting watchfully standing by the door. Never hit seventeen. When you play against the dealer. You know that the odds won't ride with you. Never leave your woman alone with your friends around to steal her. She'll be gambled and gone like summer wages. And the years are gambled and lost like summer wages.	8
	happy trials	Sons of the Pioneers				Some trails are happy ones, others are blue. It's the way you ride the trail that counts, here's a happy one for you. Happy trails to you, until we meet again. Happy trails to you, keep smiling until then. Who cares about the clouds when we're together? Just sing a song, and bring the sunny weather. Happy trails to you, until we meet again.	16

	Remember You Young	Thomas Rhett				Hey, buddies that I grew up with. All straight-laced and married up now. You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago. We tore the roof off that one red light town. And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine. All classy, kicked back on the couch. You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila. Us shuttin' them college bars down.

	two occassions	The Deele				A summer love is beautiful, but it's not enough to satisfy emotions that are shared between us.A winter love is cozy but I need so much more.

Ooh now, I can do that) Will you cater to every fantasy I got? Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot? Will you take me places I've never known? (Now, I can do that.

I won't do that) I know the territory, I've been around. It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down. Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around (I won't do that. No, I won't do that). Anything for love. Oh, I would do anything for love. I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. No, I won't do that.	4

	 Raglan Road	The Dubliners				On Raglan Road on an autumn day I saw her first and knew that her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I passed along the enchanted way, and I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. On Grafton Street in November, we tripped lightly along the ledge of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, the Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay. Oh I loved too much and by such by such is happiness thrown away. I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known to the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone. And word and tint without stint for I gave her poems to say. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May. On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now. Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow that I had loved not as I should a creature made of clay. When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day.	9

Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do. I'd love to see me from your point of view. I'm gеtting used to receiving. Still gеtting good at not leaving. I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared). Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh). You love my lips 'cause they say the things we've always been afraid of. I can feel it startin' to subside. Learnin' to believe in what is mine. I wanna love me (Ooh) the way that you love me (Ooh). Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too. I'd love to see me from your point of view. I wanna trust me (Trust me) the way that you trust me (Trust me). Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do. I'd love to see me from your point of view. I couldn't believe it or see it for myself. Know I be impatient, but now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'. Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right. I won't keep you waitin', waitin'. All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin'). And if my eyes deceive me, won't let them stray too far away. I wanna love me (Ooh) the way that you love me (Ooh). Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too. I'd love to see me from your point of view. I wanna trust me (Trust me) the way that you trust me. (Trust me). Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do. I'd love to see me from your point of view. (Oh) Yeah.	6.5
	Scenes From an Italian Restaurant	Billy Joel				A bottle of white, a bottle of red. Perhaps a bottle of rosé instead. We'll get a table near the street in our old familiar place. You and I, face to face, mmm. A bottle of red, a bottle of white. It all depends upon your appetite. I'll meet you any time you want in our Italian restaurant. Things are okay with me these days. Got a good job, got a good office. Got a new wife, got a new life and the family is fine. Oh, lost touch long ago. You lost weight, I did not know. You could ever look so nice after so much time. You remember those days. Hanging out at the Village Green? Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans. Oh, you drop a dime in the box. Play the song about New Orleans. Cold beer, hot lights. My sweet romantic teenage nights. Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies and the king and the queen of the prom. Riding around with the car top down and the radio on. Nobody looked any finer or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner. We never knew we could want more than that out of life. Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive. Brenda and Eddie were still going steady in the summer of '75. When they decided their marriage should be at the end of July. Everyone said they were crazy "Brenda you know that you're much too lazy and Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life." Oh but there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye. Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpets. And a couple of paintings from Sears. A big waterbed that they. Bought with the bread. They had saved for a couple of years. They started to fight when the money got tight and they just didn't count on the tears. Yeah, rock and roll! Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style, but it's always the same in the end. They got a divorce as a matter of course and they parted the closest of friends. Then the king and the queen went back to the green, but you can never go back there again. Brenda and Eddie had had it already by the summer of '75. From the high to the low to the end of the show. For the rest of their lives. They couldn't go back to the Greasers. The best they could do was pick up their pieces. We always knew they would both find a way to get by. And that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie. Can't tell you more 'cause I told you already. And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye. Bottle of red, bottle of white. Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight. I'll meet you anytime you want in our Italian restaurant.	5.5

	Who left the door to heaven open	Hank Thompson				Someone must have known that I was lonely. That's why they sent you to me from above. I know someone must have heard me crying. And gave me such an angel that I love. Who left the door to heaven open? Who turned their head for a moment? Who told you that my heart was broken? And who left the door to heaven open? Heaven just can't be the same without you. I guess you must have been their brightest star. And, tonight, I know the angels all will miss you. But they know just exactly where you are. Who left the door to heaven open? Who turned their head for a moment? Who told you that my heart was broken? And who left the door to heaven open? Who left the door to heaven open?	11.2
	lover's rock	TV Girl				Are you sick of me? Would you like to be? I'm tryna tell you something, something that I already said. You like a pretty boy with a pretty voice. Who's trying to sell you something, something that you already have. But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right. She might let you stay but just for the night. And if she grabs for your hand and drags you along, she might want a kiss before the end of the song. Because love, can burn like a cigarette and leave you with nothing. And leave you with nothing. While the others talk, we were listening to lovers rock. In her bedroom, in her bedroom. And if you start to kiss and the record skips. Flip it over and sit a little closer. But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right. She might let you stay but just for the night. And if she grabs for your hand and drags you along, she might want a kiss before the end of the song. Because love, can burn like a cigarette and leave you with nothing. And leave you with nothing.	9

	So Good	Al Jarreau				There's no greater crime than wastin' your life on a boat goin' nowhere. When you came along, you made it safe for love to survive. I trusted and dreamed and you came like I knew you would. I've been 'round before, but this feels so good. I could not walk by. I knew that I'd found what's at the end of the rainbow. There's no place on earth I'd rather be than stayin' right here with you. It's not about luck. I don't need to knock on wood, no no. Been 'round before but this feels so good. Night after night. It's so hard to believe that I wake up each day next to you. Time after time. In the cold mornin' light it's good to know it's good to know that it's true. There's no greater sin than missin' your chance, but when it's starin' right at 'ya. That look in your eyes say everything and tells me I'm home. For once in my life you know I don't feel misunderstood. Well I've been 'round before. Oh but this time you know it feels so sure. Been 'round before but this feels so good. Been, been 'round before. This feels so good. You all sing. So good, so good, so good. So good, so good, this feels so good. This is what I mean. Exactly what I am talking about. This feels so good. So good, so good so good. So good, so good. This feels so good. So good, so good, so good. So good.	8

	Hang	Trace Adkins				Blackberries are ripe on Taylor Ridge. I'll pick you a daisy on the way. Walking ties on the railroad bridge. Go find a spot there in the shade. Throw a blanket down on the ground and hang. Got hooked up with some homemade wine. Hid it in the moss at the foot of the bluff. Later on when that old moon shines. We can tip it back and catch a buzz by the creek. Beat the heat. Sit on that rock and let our feet hang. Hey baby, what do you say we take a walk. Get gone? Maybe find a place where we can get lost. Later on. Be one with the stars in the dark and hang. Blackberry kiss on white tan lines. Midnight song of the whip-poor-ill. Third cup of that homemade wine. Don't you wanna know how that feels on out there? Middle of nowhere. Where you can let your long, honeysuckle hair hang. Hey baby, what do you say we take a walk. Get gone? Maybe find a place where we can get lost. Later on. Be one with the stars in the dark and hang. Oh, baby, we can jump in, take a swim. Drip dry off in the night wind and hang. Hey, baby, what do you say we take a walk? Maybe find a place to get lost and hang.	9

	Smile	nat king cole				Smile though your heart is aching. Smile even though it's breaking. When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by. If you smile through your fear and sorrow, smile and maybe tomorrow you'll see the sun come shining through for you. Light up your face with gladness. Hide every trace of sadness.

	I can only be me	Keith John				Butterflies begin from having been another as a child is born from being in a mother's womb. But how many times have you wished you were some other, someone than who you are. Yet who's to say if all were uncovered, you will like what you see. You can only be you as I can only be me. Flowers cannot bloom until it is their season as we would not be here unless it was our destiny, but how many times have you wished to be in spaces. Time places than what you were. Yet who's to say with unfamiliar faces. You could anymore be loving you that you see. You can only be you as I can only be me.	11

	Fuck the Police	N.W.A				Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect. Judge Dre presiding in the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department; prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy-motherfucking-E. Order, order, order. Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help your black ass? You goddamn right! Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown. And not the other color so police think they have the authority to kill a minority. Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun to be beating on, and thrown in jail. We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell. Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager with a little bit of gold and a pager. Searching my car, looking for the product. Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics. You'd rather see, me in the pen than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o. Beat a police out of shape and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape. To tape off the scene of the slaughter. Still getting swoll off bread and water. I don't know if they fags or what. Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts. And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none. But don't let it be a black and a white one. 'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top. Black police showing out for the white cop. Ice Cube will swarm on any motherfucker in a blue uniform. Just 'cause I'm from, the CPT. Punk police are afraid of me! HUH, a young nigga on the warpath. And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath of cops, dying in L.A. Yo Dre, I got something to say. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Example of scene one. Pull your goddamn ass over right now. Aww shit, now what the fuck you pulling me over for? 'Cause I feel like it! Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up. Man, fuck this shit. Aight smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail! MC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked-up incident? Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority because the niggas on the street is a majority. A gang is with whoever I'm stepping and the motherfucking weapon is kept in a stash box for the so-called law. Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw. Lights start flashing behind me. But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me. But that shit don't work, I just laugh because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path. For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you punk!" Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk. Pulling out a silly club, so you stand with a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand. But take off the gun so you can see what's up. And we'll go at it punk, and I'mma fuck you up! Make you think I'mma kick your ass but drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast. I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime. But I'mma smoke 'em now and not next time. Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me or any asshole that threatens me..I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope. Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me. The motherfucking villain that's mad. With potential to get bad as fuck. So I'mma turn it around. Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound. Yeah, something like that but it all depends on the size of the gat. Taking out a police, would make my day. But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Yeah man, what you need? Police, open now. Aww shit. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest. Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em (Move motherfucker, move now!). What the fuck did I do, man what did I do? Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!). But I didn't do shit. Man just shut the fuck up! Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? I'm tired of the motherfucking jacking. Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt. I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast on a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger of an Uzi or an AK. 'Cause the police always got something stupid to say. They put out my picture with silence. 'Cause my identity by itself causes violence. The E with the criminal behavior. Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still I got flavor. Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot by me or another nigga. And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger ([MC Ren:] Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool). And as you all know, E's here to rule. Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror. And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a dumb motherfucker with a gun. And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one that I take out, and then get away. While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. Fuck the police. The verdict. The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chickenshit motherfucker. Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie! Get him out of here! I want justice! Get him the fuck out my face! I want justice! Out, right now! Fuck you, you black motherfuckers! Fuck the police! Fuck the police! Fuck the police!	5

I know you're clingin' to the light of day to tell you everything's A-okay. And medication don't do much. Yeah, it just numbs the brain. Guess you might say I'm a little intense. I'm on the bright side of bein' hell bent. So, take it from me, you're not the only one who can't see straight (Can't see straight). If you were ever in doubt. Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof. Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed, but you gotta try, and I'm callin' out. Get up, get up, get a move on. Get up, get up, what's takin' so long. Get up, get up, get a move on. Stop stallin', I'm callin' out. Get up, get up, get a move on. Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong. 'Cause I believe you can be whatever. And I agree you can do much better, trust me. (Trust me). Everybody wants to sing their song. So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?" Ain't nothin' normal when it comes to you and me. I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams. If you were ever in doubt. Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof. Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed, but you gotta try, and I'm callin' out. Get up, get up, get a move on.

Sometimes you're wrong, sometimes you're right. Just gotta keep movin'. Yeah. I'm just gonna keep movin'. Today, tomorrow, and the next. Get up, get up, get a move on. Get up, get up, what's takin' so long. Get up, get up, get a move on. Stop stallin', I'm callin' out. Get up, get up, get a move on. Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong.

	White Room 	Cream				In the white room with black curtains near the station. Black-roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings. Silver horses run down moonbeams in your dark eyes. Dawn-light smiles on you leaving, my contentment. I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines; Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves. You said no strings could secure you at the station. Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows. I walked into such a sad time at the station. As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning. I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back; Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves. At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd. Consolation for the old wound now forgotten. Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes. She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings. I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd; Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.	9
	You Look Beautiful	Chris de Burgh				You're looking good, I haven't seen you for a long time. How've you been? I like the way you have your hair, but something has changed. And I can see a woman in your eyes, and in your smile. Remember when we'd always be together, and we believed this love would never die. And ever since then, I've often wondered how I'd feel if we should meet again. And you look beautiful, you look wonderful. You're like an angel heaven sent to me. You look beautiful, you look wonderful. I've got a feeling this was meant to be. When we broke apart, we both set off to find the world and face the storms of life. I thought I heard you calling. When your ship hit the rocks and here we are survivors from the sea, just you and me, out on the beach. If you have time, lets get a cup of coffee, and talk about all the feelings that we share. Cos when there's still love, you know it from the moment that you see. Those eyes again. And you look beautiful, you look wonderful. You're like an angel heaven sent to me. You look beautiful, you look wonderful. I've got a feeling this was meant to be. Yes I know it this was meant to be. You look wonderful. Now I know it, this was meant to be.	8
	lost in your eyes	Debbie Gibson				I get lost in your eyes and I feel my spirits rise and soar like the wind. Is it love that I am in? I get weak in a glance. Isn't this what's called romance? And now I know 'cause when I'm lost, I can let go. I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for. You can take me to the skies. It's like being lost in heaven when I'm lost in your eyes. I just fell, don't know why. Something's there we can't deny. And when I first knew was when I first looked at you. And if I can't find my way if salvation is worlds away. Oh, I'll be found when I am lost in your eyes. I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for. You can take me to the skies. It's like being lost in heaven when I'm lost in your eyes. I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for. You can take me to the skies. It's like being lost in heaven when I'm lost in your eyes. I get weak in a glance. Isn't this what's called romance? Oh, I'll be found when I am lost in your eyes.	9.5
	I do	morgan Evans				Not everyone gets drunk without a drop of wine or a sip of 90 proof, but I do. Not everybody loves getting caught at red lights. They got no one to lean into, but I do. You don't know how many times and minutes you cross my mind. And I don't know what I did so right. Just when I think it couldn't get any better to be the man standing in my shoes. There you go walking in in a new dress saying "do you like this?" And baby, I do wanna hold you forever. No, I ain't ever been so sure. Just when I think I couldn't love you any more. Baby, I do, I do, I do. Baby, I do, I do, I do. Yeah girl you're beautiful. Just takes one look to see, but no one sees the sides of you, I do. Like your hair in a mess in the morning that wake up, no makeup smile. That I can't believe I open my eyes to but I do. Just when I think it couldn't get any better to be the man standing in my shoes. There you go walking in in a new dress saying "do you like this?" And baby, I do wanna hold you forever. No, I ain't ever been so sure. Just when I think I couldn't love you any more. Baby, I do, I do, I do. Baby, I do, I do, I do. No I don't ever fall like this. I never found myself wanting to jump in so quick, but there's something different about you 'cause I do, I do. Just when I think it couldn't get any better to be the man standing in my shoes. There you go walking in in a new dress saying "do you like this?" And baby, I do wanna hold you forever. No, I ain't ever been so sure. Just when I think I couldn't love you any more. Baby, I do, I do, I do. Baby, I do, I do, I do. Baby, I do wanna hold you forever. I don't ever wanna let you go. And every day, I'm gonna let you know how much that I do, I do, I do. 'Cause baby I do, I do, I do.	 7
	Half the Man	Clint Black				She's every reason I take so much work off. And every reason I take so much time at home. And every single reason why I'm so much stronger. And every reason I could never be alone. Look at me, you'll see who I've found. I'm beside myself whenever she's around. Without her, you'd see a different man. It's what she's makes of me, she's half the man I am. When the rivers all run dry, she finds the water. And when everything is dark, she finds the light. And when it's time to fly, she's flying with me. With her on the wing, we balance out just right. Look at me, you'll see who I've found. I'm beside myself whenever she's around. Without her, you'd see a different man. It's what she's makes of me, she's half the man I am. I'm what she's made of me, she's half the man I am.	10.5

You should've said "Nice to meet you, I'm your other half". And this is the best thing, the best thing that could be happening. And I think you would agree. The best thing is that it's happening.

	Sure Love	Hal Ketchum				There's a new star in my sky. There's a new song in my life. Some may take love casually, but I know what it's worth to me. I would count the steps from here to heaven every heartache I was given. Tip my hat and walk through fire to find sure love. I would chase old ghosts and watch them scatter. Drop old dreams and watch them shatter. Lose myself and all I own to find sure love, to find sure love. I wake up and she is there. And for a moment I just stare for the sake of love this true, there is nothing I won't do. I would count the steps from here to heaven. Every heartache I was given.

	Gungor	Vous Etes Mon Coeur				Where have you hidden yourself oh my beloved. You fled having wounded. I pursued but you had gone. In search of you my darling I would scale the highest clouds.

	He Didn’t have to be	Brad Paisley				When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new. It always winds up feelin' more like a job interview. My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run. I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old.

	/Make Me a Channel of Your Peace 	Prayer of St. Francis				Lord make Me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sadness joy. O Divine master grant that I may. Not so much seek to be consoled as to console. To be understood, as to understand. To be loved. as to love. For it's in giving that we receive and it's in pardoning that we are pardoned. And it's in dying that we are born to eternal life. Aaamen.	12
	I miss you 	Blink 182				I miss you, I miss you. Hello, there. The angel from my nightmare. The shadow in the background of the morgue. The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley. We can live like Jack and Sally if we want. Where you can always find me and we'll have Halloween on Christmas. And in the night, we'll wish this never ends. We'll wish this never ends. I miss you, I miss you. I miss you, I miss you. Where are you? And I'm so sorry. I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight. I need somebody and always. This sick, strange darkness. Comes creeping on, so haunting every time. And as I stare, I counted. The webs from all the spiders. Catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you. And hear your voice of treason. Will you come home and stop this pain tonight? Stop this pain tonight. Don't waste your time on me, you're already. The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you). Don't waste your time on me, you're already. The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you). Don't waste your time on me, you're already. The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you).

You're my grace. You're the smile I've been wearing on my face. You're my favorite. I've seen the perfect sunset paint the desert sky. A clear night on the ocean when the stars came alive.

	Let There Be Love	Nat King Cole				Let there be you, let there be me. Let there be oysters under the sea. Let there be wind, an occasional rain. Chile con carne, sparkling champagne.

Let there be cuckoos, a lark, and a dove. But first of all, please, let there be love, love, love. Let there be love.	15

	Rodeo	Garth Brooks				His eyes are cold and restless. His wounds have almost healed. And she'd give half of Texas just to change the way he feels. She knows his love's in Tulsa and she knows he's gonna go. Well it ain't no woman flesh and blood. It's that damned old rodeo. Well it's bulls and blood. It's dust and mud. It's the roar of a Sunday crowd. It's the white in his knuckles. The gold in the buckle. He'll win the next go 'round. It's boots and chaps. It's cowboy hats. It's spurs and latigo. It's the ropes and the reins. And the joy and the pain. And they call the thing rodeo.

	Everywhere But On	Matt Stell				It's a big ol' world outside this little town. Thought that's all I needed to drown you out. It was gonna be easy, it was supposed to be easy. Put some days, put some miles in the rearview. A few state lines between me and you. Just a little space and time and I'd be fine. I've been from Savannah to Long Beach. Trying to keep your memory out of reach. But there you were in the Delta nights. The Santa Fe sun, the Colorado sky. I could add another push pin to the map, but that don't stop me from missing you and looking back. Guess there's just one place I haven't gone. I've moved everywhere but on. My mail's still going to mama's house 'cause I'm still long gone trying to figure out. Who I am without you and why I still think about you. Just biding my time making ends meet. Loading trucks, pouring coffee, pouring concrete. Planning my next move for getting over you, yeah. I've been from Savannah to Long Beach. Trying to keep your memory out of reach. But there you were in the Delta nights. The Santa Fe sun, the Colorado sky. I could add another push pin to the map, but that don't stop me from missing you and looking back. Guess there's just one place I haven't gone. I've moved everywhere but on. I had it my way, this ol' highway would have fixed me up somehow. Would have led me home by now. I've been from Savannah to Long Beach. Trying to keep your memory out of reach. But there you were in the Delta nights. The Santa Fe sun, the Colorado sky.

	Don’t ever grow up 	Taylor Swift				Your little hand's wrapped around my finger. And it's so quiet in the world tonight. Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming. So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light. To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret. I'd give all I have, honey if you could stay like that. Oh darling, don't you ever grow up.

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up. Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple. No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred.

Remember the footsteps, remember the words said and all your little brother's favorite songs. I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone. So here I am in my new apartment in a big city, they just dropped me off. It's so much colder than I thought it would be. So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on. Wish I'd never grown up, I wish I'd never grown up. Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up. I could still be little..Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up. It could still be simple. Oh darling, don't you ever grow up. Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little. Oh darling, don't you ever grow up. Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple. Won't let nobody hurt you. Won't let no one break your heart. And even though you want to, please try to never grow up. Oh, don't you ever grow up. Oh, never grow up, just never grow up.	6
						"There was a time when I was alone. Nowhere to go and no place to call home..My only friend was the man in the Moon. And even sometimes he would go away too. Then one night, as I closed my eyes I saw a shadow flying high. He came to me with the sweetest smile. Told me he wanted to talk for a while. He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me. I promise that you'll never be lonely"" And ever since that day. I am a Lost Boy from Neverland. Usually hanging out with Peter Pan. And when we're bored we play in the woods, always on the run from Captain Hook. ""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me. Away from all of reality. Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me. And Lost Boys like me are free. Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me. And Lost Boys like me are free. He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe. Believe in him and believe in me. Together we will fly away in a cloud of green to your beautiful destiny. As we soared above the town that never loved me, I realized I finally had a family. Soon enough we reached Neverland. Peacefully my feet hit the sand. And ever since that day. I am a Lost Boy from Neverland. Usually hanging out with Peter Pan. And when we're bored we play in the woods, always on the run from Captain Hook. ""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me. Away from all of reality. Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me. And Lost Boys like me are free. Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me. And Lost Boys like me are free. Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling. Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook. Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home. Forever a Lost Boy at last. And for always I will say. I am a Lost Boy from Neverland. Usually hanging out with Peter Pan. And when we're bored we play in the woods, always on the run from Captain Hook. ""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me. Away from all of reality. Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me.

	The Story Of My Life	Michael Crawford				The story of my life is very plain to read. It starts the day you came and ends the day you leave. The story of my life begins and ends with you. The names are still the same, and the story's still the truth. I was alone. You found me waiting and made me your own. I was afraid that somehow I never could be the man that you wanted of me. You're the story of my life and every word is true. Each chapter sings your name. Each page begins with you. Stay with me here, share with me, care with me, stay and be near. And when it began, I'd lie awake every night just knowing somewhere deep inside that our love affair just might write - the story of my life, so very plain to read. It starts the day you came and ends the day you leave.	10

Move me, baby. So move me, baby like you've nothin' left to lose and nothin' to prove. Move me, baby. So move me, baby. Shake like the bough of a willow tree. You do it naturally. Move me, baby.	7.5
	Two of us on the run 	Lucius				There are two of us on the run. Going so fast, every doubt we had is coming undone. And falling behind with everything we left there, we held on for far too long. And now we pass so many people on the road. They could come along, I wish they'd been told. They may call it a shot in the dark. From what we know, it's not unheard of. And we'll one day, tell our story of how we made something of ourselves now. Our favorite parts are what we'll keep. Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories. So everything else has room to grow. 'Cause in better light, everything changes. So we can one day tell our story of how we made something of ourselves now. There's no race, there's only a runner. Just keep one foot in front of the other. There's no race, there's only a runner, oh, oh. 1, 2, 3, even when you get tired. Just keep one foot in front of the other. There's no race, no ending in sight. No second too short, no window too tight. So turn off the lights when you leave. 'Cause we've got everything we're gonna need. We're on the run, we're on the run. We're on the run, child. We gotta run, we gotta run. We gotta run, child. One day, tell our story of how we made something of ourselves now. One day, tell our story of how we made something. We made something of ourselves.	8
	Made by God	Rutshelle Guillaume				Just in two of us on this island. We just make in love no other plans. Starring on this stories hold and hands. Open that moment and never end. Maybe lets remember that. We where made by God to prove that love exist. If ever I get lost, I know my soul will find yours. Valè mizè m' konen m' pase. Bagay ou patap janm panse. Ou vinn lavi'm pou yon rezon. Menm lè gen fènwa ou banm direksyon. Ou fèm komprann kiyès mwen ye. Ou montre'm kisak lavi a de. Menm si male byen lwen. Cheri konnen map tounen. But I have to confess that I am or danm blesss to have you as a gift. Even if I'm a mess. Lafimen pa leve san dife. Like there's no mean without you bae. We where made by God to prove that love exist. If ever I get lost, I know my soul will find yours. I know my soul will find yours. I know my soul will find yours. We where made by God to prove that love exist. If ever I get lost, I know my soul will find yours. I know my soul will find yours. I know my soul will find yours.	9
	Fall on Me	Andrea & Matteo Bocelli in Italian				I thought sooner or later the lights up above will come down in circles and guide me to love, but I don't know what's right for me. I cannot see straight. I've been here too long and I don't want to wait for it. Fly like a cannonball. Straight to my soul. Tear me to pieces and make me feel whole. I'm willing to fight for it and carry this weight, but with every step, I keep questioning what is true. Fall on me with open arms. Fall on me from where you are. Fall on me with all your light, with all your ligh, with all your light. Presto una luce ti illuminerà. Seguila sempre, guidarti saprà. Tu non arrenderti. Attento a non perderti. E il tuo passato avrà senso per te. Vorrei che credessi in te stesso, ma sì. In ogni passo che muoverai qui. È un viaggio infinito. Sorriderò se. Nel tempo che fugge mi porti con te. Fall on mescoltami. Fall on me abbracciami. Fall on me finché vorrai, finché vorrai, finché vorrai, finché vorrai. I close my eyes and I'm seeing you everywhere. I step outside. It's like I'm breathing you in the air. I can feel you're there. Fall on me ascoltami. Fall on me abbracciami. Fall on me with all your light, with all your light, with all your light.	8
	I Can’t Stop Loving You 	Van Halen				There's a time and place for everything, for everyone. We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come. Oh no, nothing's gonna change. And if I asked you not to try. Oh could you let it be. I wanna hold you and say. We can't throw this all away. Tell me you won't go, you won't go. Do you have to hear me say. I can't stop lovin' you. And no matter what you say or do, you know my heart is true, oh. I can't stop lovin' you. You can change your friends, your place in life. You can change your mind. We can change the things we say and do it anytime. Oh no, but I think you'll find that when you look inside your heart. Oh baby, I'll be there. Hold on, I'm holding on. Baby, just come on, come on, come on. I just wanna hear you say. I can't stop lovin' you. And no matter what you say or do, you know my heart is true, oh. I can't stop lovin' you. Oh, I'm twisted and tied and all I can remember is how hard we tried only to surrender. And when it's over, I know how it's gonna be. And true love will never die. No, not fade away. I can't stop lovin' you. And no matter what you say or do, you know my heart is true, oh. I can't stop lovin' you. And I know what I got to do. Hey Ray, what you said is true. I can't stop lovin' you, oh. Oh, I can't stop lovin' you.	8
	Marry you	BB king and Eric Clapton				It's the sugar so sweet. Kind I'd like to meet you at midnight and tell no one else about it. I'm going to make you mine. 'Cause I know we've got the time. Now and then, baby. Hey, I want you to know. I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? Come on in the back of the '57. Let me show you the way, the way to heaven. You're looking so sweet, yes you are. I'm sure that you've got some heat. I've got you on my mind. You know you've got my time. Now and then, baby. Hey, I want you to know. I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? I'm falling in love with you. You make all my dreams come true. I'm falling in love with you. I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too? I want to marry you. Isn't that what you want, too?	9
	As	Stevie Wonder				As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving, and the rosebuds know to bloom in early May. Just as hate knows love's the cure, you can rest your mind assured that I'll be loving you always. As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow, but in passing will grow older every day. Just as all that's born is new, do know what I say is true that I'll be loving you always. Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky always. Until the ocean covers every mountain high always. Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea always. Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream. Did you know that true love asks for nothing? Her acceptance is the way we pay. Did you know that life has given love a guarantee? To last through forever and another day. Just as time knew to move on since the beginning and the seasons know exactly when to change. Just as kindness knows no shame, know through all your joy and pain that I'll be loving you always. As today, I know I'm living but tomorrow could make me the past but that I mustn't fear for I'll know deep in my mind the love of me I've left behind 'cause I'll be loving you always. Until the day is night and night becomes the day always. Until the trees and seas just up and fly away always. Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four always. Until the day that is the day that are no more. Did you know you're loved by somebody? Until the day the earth starts turning right to left always. Until the earth just for the sun denies itself, I'll be loving you forever. Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through always. Until the day that you are me and I am you. Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky always. We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles. Can make you wish you were born in another time and space, but you can bet your life times that and twice it's double that God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed. So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it, you're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell. Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love and maybe our children's grandchildren and their great-great-grandchildren will tell, I'll be loving you.	6
	Rest In His Love and Abide	John Bauer				May the God of Hope touch you with His love as you place your trust in His Son. May His gentle Spirit fill you with His joy as you walk by faith in what He's done. May His peace follow you in believing as you find sweet release in receiving. May your mind overflow and abound with hope as His Spirit fills you inside. May you know His power every day of your life as you trust in Him now to provide. May you know His power every day of your life as you trust in Him now to provide, as you trust in Him now to provide.	13

	How Deep The Father's Love For Us	Selah				How deep the Father’s love for us, how vast beyond all measure, that He should give His only Son to make a wretch His treasure. How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turns His face away as wounds which marred the Chosen One bring many sons to glory. Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon His shoulders; Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers. It was my sin that held Him there until it was accomplished; His dying breath has brought me life, I know that it is finished. I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom; but I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection. Why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer; but this I know with all my heart, His wounds have paid my ransom.	10
	Married Life	Alexa Wilhelm				I never knew I could love one as much as you to the moment I fell in your arms. And now it's clear you are my dear. Lovin' easy when you love your best friend. Adventure here, adventure there, and everywhere. You and I can go take on the world. So never fear, I'll be right here. Right here next to you for all we will do. When we were young and all our days were filled with fun, I remember the memories we made. We made a book, then built our house to overlook everything to see, darling, you and me. I always knew you were the one, and that is true. Our adventure has only begun. I'll cross my heart and promise we will never part. Our future is near only up from here.	11
	I Need You	Marc Anthony				From the day that I met you, girl, I knew that your love would be everything that I ever wanted in my life. From the moment you spoke my name, I knew everything had changed. Because of you, I felt my life would be complete. Oh, baby, I need you. For the rest of my life, girl, I need you. To make everything right, girl, I love you and I'll never deny that I need you. Nothing matters, but you, my love, and only God above could be the one to know exactly how I feel. I could die in your arms right now knowing that you somehow would take my soul and keep it deep inside your heart. Oh, baby, I need you. For the rest of my life, girl, I need you. To make everything right, girl, I love you and I'll never deny that I need you. Girl, your love to me feels just like magic. When you smile, you have total control. You have power like nothing I've felt before. I've let all of my feelings show cuz I want you to know that I need you. I need you for the rest of my life, girl. I need you, say that you'll be my wife, oh. I love you. Won't you marry me, marry me? Oh, I need you (nobody but you). Oooh, I need you for the rest of my life. Oh, I need you (nobody but you). Won't you marry me, marry me? I love you, I really need ya, baby (I really need nobody but you). I need you. Girl, I really need, need you, girl, I really need you, need you (I need you). Oohhh, baby, I love you (I love you). I need you. Girl, I really need ya, need ya, oh baby. Won't you marry me (I need you)? Won't you marry me, marry me? I love you, oohh.

	Without You	My Darkest Days				If I had my way, I'd spend every day right by your side. And if I could stop time, believe me, I'd try for you and I. And each moment you're gone is a moment too long in my life. So stay right here, right now. 'Cause without you, I'm a disaster (the moment you go) and you're my ever after (Just thought you should know) 'cause I need to know your answer (Just say you'll stay with me). I want you to say you're gonna stay with me (Just say you'll stay with me). I die every day that you're away from me. If the world ceased to spin, you could start it again with just one smile. If the seas turn to sand with the wave of your hand, it would rain for miles, but the thought of you gone makes everything wrong in my life. So stay right here, right now. 'Cause without you, I'm a disaster (the moment you go) and you're my ever after (Just thought you should know) 'cause I need to know your answer (Just say you'll stay with me).

So just say you'll promise me, please, take me if you ever leave, but the thought of you gone makes everything wrong in my life. So stay right here, right now. 'Cause without you, I'm a disaster (the moment you go) and you're my ever after (Just thought you should know) 'cause I need to know your answer (Just say you'll stay with me).

My heart breaks with every beat. I die every day that you're away from me.	7
	I Pray For You	Rachel Kamps				In the quiet of the morning light, I pray for you (for you). In the middle of the day, in the midst of the fray, I pray for you (I pray for you). In the evening hour at the end of the day, I pray for you. In the toss and turn of a sleepless night, I pray for you. In prayer, I hold you close where my love keeps you most. In prayer, I've learned to know that it's God's will that's best and that you don't walk alone on this truth I rest. God listens anyway to words I do not say as I pray for you (for you). God gives me reprieve when it's hard to believe as I pray for you (I pray for you). God holds my heart through the hurt of hope deferred as I pray for you. God gives me peace and quiet confidence as I pray for you. May God light your candle, may it stive full bright; and may His strength be your might to walk through the night. Trade His joy for your sorrows todays and tomorrows. In prayer, I hold you close where my love keeps you most. In prayer, I've learned to know that it's God's will that's best and that you don't walk alone on this truth I rest.	9
	Adelita Rose	Ian Tyson				Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, you know she is my sunshine wherever she goes. Ladada, dedede, ladada, dedede, she is my sunshine wherever she goes. Adelita Rose stay in your own little bed tonight for the sake of your mamma and me, we gotta get some sleep. Tomorrow's gonna come early. We don't wanna hear any sound at all. Don't want to hear little feet comin' down the hall. Go to sleep, dream of all the pretty little horses. The blacks and bays, and dapples and grays. The red-tailed hawk on the summer days. The gravel roads windin' down to the river and watch that pony or goodness knows. He's gonna step on your baby toes. Go to sleep, dream of all those pretty little horses. Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, you know she is my sunshine wherever she goes. Mmhmmm, lalala, laylaylee, lalala, laylaylee, she is my sunshine wherever she goes.	10
	I Do	David Allen Buckner				I never thought I'd be the type to ever settle down not me, no way, no how, but that was up until I saw you come around. Now, it's you and I, right now holding hands, making plans for the future. Wishing we would have met each other sooner. Now, I can't wait 'til the day I slide a ring on your pretty little finger. I do promise to be your everything, your wants, and needs. You pick me up when you need the strength. I'll be a place to lean when you've had enough, feel like giving up. Just know I'll always love you and if you ever feel like I don't, I do. You always said I was made to be a damn good daddy, aww, but I just shrugged it off. I couldn't see myself taking care of little babies. You said it'd change when I had my own two pink lines and nine months later heading home in a pretty pink sweater. I looked at her, she looked at me. All the rest was history when I said I do promise to be your everything, your wants, and needs. You pick me up when you need the strength. I'll be a place to lean when you've had enough, feel like giving up. Just know I'll always love you and if you ever feel like I don't, I do. Days will come and go and our hair will start to gray. Our little girl will grow up and move away when we're looking back on all the memories we've made. With every change, there's one thing that stays the same. I do promise to be your everything, your wants, and needs. You pick me up when you need the strength. I'll be a place to lean when you've had enough, feel like giving up. Just know I'll always love you and if you ever feel like I don't, I do. Until my last breath and the good Lord calls me home, I do.	7
	You're The Best Thing	Josh Tatofi				I′ve had my share of life's ups & downs, but fate′s been kind. The downs have been few. I guess you could say that I've been lucky. Well, I guess you could say that it's all because of you. If anyone should ever write my life story for whatever reason there might be. Ooh, you′ll be there between each line of pain & glory ′cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me. Oh, you′re the best thing that ever happened to me. There have been times when times are hard. I somehow made it. I made it through. For every, every moment that I've spent hurting, there was a moment that I′ve spent just lovin' you. If anyone should ever write my life story for whatever reason there might be. Oh, you′ll be there between each line of pain & glory 'cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me. Oh, you′re the best thing that ever happened to me.	10
	It's You	Meredith Willson				It's you in the sunrise, it's you in my cup. It's you all the way into town. It's your sweet "Hello, dear" that sets me up and it's your "Got to go, dear" that gets me down. It's you on my pillow in all my dreams 'til once more the morning breaks through. What words could be saner or truer or plainer than it's you, it's you. Yes, it's you. Oh, yes it's you.	16
	Believe	Laura Bretan and The Tenors				I was dreaming alone. Just a face in the crowd. Love was only a hope. I was living without, but I knew in my heart, darling, every cloud has a silver lining. And for every night, a new day will come. I held onto the light that was leading me on, and I knew in my heart if I reach for the sun it would soon be shining. And then I saw you there, the answer to all my prayers. Now there's magic in my life. When you believe in miracles, nothing in this world can bring you down. Yes, I believe in miracles. Nobody can stop us now. I see the smile on your face and the stars in your eyes. You're my luckiest day, you're my sweetest surprise, and I know in my heart with the love so strong that we can move mountains. Cause when I see you there, the answer to all my prayers. You're the magic in my life. When you believe in miracles, nothing in this world can bring you down. Yes, I believe in miracles. Nobody can stop us now. Crede et confide (Yes, I believe).

When you believe, like we believe in miracles.	8.5

We go on, I will always long as I live (long as I live). You will be my first love (ah baby, you and only) long as I live (long as I live). You will be my first love and I choose you again.

	That's What Friends Are For	Dionne Warwick				And I never thought I'd feel this way. And as far as I'm concerned, I'm glad I got the chance to say that I do believe I love you. And if I should ever go away, well, then close your eyes and try to feel the way we do today and then, if you can remember. Keep smiling, keep shining, knowing you can always count on me, for sure. That's what friends are for. For good times and bad times, I'll be on your side forevermore. That's what friends are for. Well, you came in loving me, and now there's so much more, I see, and so, by the way, I thank you. Oh, and then for the times when we're apart.

	Senseless	Mason Lively				I'm breaking all my arrows. I'm cuttin' the string off the bow. I let my guard down since you came 'round. I'll chase the white line so long, and now I'm just ready to move on. Darling, take me in. I'm worth saving, baby. Why did I take so much time to finally open up my eyes? So I'll give you all my life now. Every day and every night when the sun trades places with the moon, I'm prayin'. If tomorrow I lose everything I own, I'll still have every little thing I want, so I'll mend these fences 'cause I'd bе senseless not loving you. You'rе the grace that I fell far from, but now I'm changin', I have learned one thing's for certain before he closes the curtains. Second chances don't come cheap, and you deserve a man who's gonna give you everything that you need. So I'll give you all my life now. Every day and every night when the sun trades places with the moon, I'm prayin'. If tomorrow I lose everything I own, I'll still have every little thing I want, so I'll mend these fences 'cause I'd be senseless not loving you. So I'll give you all my life now.

Darling, I'd be senseless not loving you.	8
	Someone	Aaron Lewis				I'm damaged goods. I'm complicated. Should have known how to tell a lie. Some people think I ain't worth saving. Sometimes I think they're right. It ain't no secret, I can say it. I get it wrong most of the time. But looking at you right now, baby, you're the one thing I've got right. Someone else would have walked away. Someone else would have never stayed. Should as hell someone else would have left me a long, long time ago, oh, oh. Someone else would have called my bluff, saying I ain't even worth enough. No one else could have loved me like you do. Thank God my someone's you. I wasn't perfect. You were patient. I didn't know what you were waiting for. I guess I must have found an angel sent from heaven's door. Someone else would have walked away. Someone else would have never stayed. Should as hell someone else would have left me a long, long time ago, oh, oh. Someone else would have called my bluff, saying I ain't even worth enough. No one else could have loved me like you do.

Thank God my someone's you. Thank God my someone's you.	7.5
	Jesus In Your Eyes	Julie Miller				Oh, look at where we are; God has brought us both so far. We've been delivered by his hand and brought to the place where we now stand. Love is patient; love is kind. Love comes through every time. Always protects, hopes, and trusts. Keeps on believing, and it never gives up. In my life, I have seen so many things, but nothing has touched me so deep inside as when I see Jesus in your eyes. In my heart, I'm very sure. In his love, ours will endure. Loving him by loving you. In serving Jesus, I will serve you too. For his glory, we will live. He has given us love to give. I am with you, heart and soul. Wherever he leads, together we will go. In my life, I have seen so many things, but nothing has touched me so deep inside as when I see Jesus in your eyes, in your eyes.	10.5

I used to get sad and lonely when the sun went down, but it's different now 'cause I love the light that I found in you. Baby, don't you know that you're my golden hour? The color of my sky, you set my world on fire. And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright, mm. You make the world look beautiful, ooh. I thought I'd seen it all before, but lookin' through your eyes, it looks like paradise. You set my world on fire, yeah. And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright. You're my golden hour. The color of my sky, you set my world on fire. And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright. Yeah, I know. I know everything's gonna be alright. Golden hour, oh.	9.5
	Home Away From Home	Canopy Climbers				Sometimes the waves they keep on crashing in. Sometimes the raining never seems to end. I'll be alright, my friend, if you stay by my side. Sometimes our worries get the best of us. Sometimes the hardest we try is not enough. All will be well, as long as you stay by my side. You help me take this weight off my shoulders. Always run my way when I call you. You're the anchor I'm holding tight onto. You are my home away from home. Home away from home. Home away from home. Home away from home. Somedays, I wonder if the sun will shine. Somedays, I pray for just a ray of light. Come take my hand and tell me you'll stay by my side. Somedays, I feel like I'm against the wall. Somedays, I feel I'm barely holding on. All will be well as long as you stay by my side. You help me take this weight off my shoulders. Always run my way when I call you. You're the anchor I'm holding tight onto. You are my home away from home. Home away from home. Home away from home. Home away from home. Whoa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, I know I am not alone. Whoa, oh, oooh, ooh, oh, you're my home away from home. Help me take this weight off my shoulders. Always run my way when I call you. You're the anchor I'm holding tight onto. You help me find my way when I'm searching. Brighten up my day when I'm hurting. You're the anchor I'm holding tight onto. You are my home away from home. Home away from home. Home away from home. Home away from home.	7.5
	I'm Being Followed by a Moonshadow	Cat Stevens				Yes, I'm being followed by a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow. Leaping and hopping on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow. And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plow, lose my land. Oh, if I ever lose my hands. Oh, if I won't have to work no more and if I ever lose my eyes. If my colours all run dry. Yes, if I ever lose my eyes. Oh, if, I won't have to cry no more. Yes, I'm being followed by a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow. Leaping and hopping on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow. And if I ever lose my legs, I won't moan, and I won't beg. Oh, if I ever lose my legs. Oh, if, I won't have to walk no more and if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north, and south. Yes, if I ever lose my mouth. Oh, if, I won't have to talk. Did it take long to find me? I ask the faithful light. Oh, did it take long to find me? And, are you gonna stay the night? I'm being followed by a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow. Leaping and hopping on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow. Moonshadow, moonshadow. Moonshadow, moonshadow.	9
	Let Us Climb The Hill Together	Paul Clark				I have waited such a long, long time for this day to come, and all I have to give is the love from God's only Son. He gave to me to give unto you. I pray that God will be with us night and day, guide us all the way. In our life, there will be no strife with Jesus Christ. And His kingdom which has come and made it possible for you and I to be one. I will make you queen of my home under the glory of the King. We'll raise our family in the castle full of love and trust the Lord in everything. Let us sing to the King, "Hallelujah!" In times of trial when things are hard to see, will you stand by me? With love, it can heal the pain, so let it rain. On the roof of my soul, there is no hole that love can't fill. So let us climb, let us climb, let us climb the hill together. Let us climb the hill together. Let us climb the hill together. Let us climb the hill together.	10.5
	God Be Praised	David and Elena Moore				You saved my life from death when I was all but defeated. You spoke Your promises and brought life to my weakness. Came as a conquering King, and You warred for my freedom. My soul can't help but sing, Hallelujah. You opened up my eyes, for the first time I saw You. Your love commanding life and deserving devotion. You told me who I am. Now in faith, I believe it. My soul can't help but sing, Hallelujah. You've made a place for me, silenced all my accusers. Leading me forth with peace. Filled with joy, I will follow. Your cross demands my life. Now your grace is my anthem. My soul can't help but sing, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah! We're redeemed and made free by the blood of the Lamb we have won. Hallelujah! We will sing victory. Jesus conquered the grave. God be praised. Hallelujah!

	Cold Heart	Elton John and Dua Lipa				It's a human sign when things go wrong. When the scent of her lingers, and temptation's strong. Cold, cold heart hardened by you (oh). Some things lookin' better, baby. Just passin' through (no, no, no, no, no) and I think it's gonna be a long, long time 'til touchdown brings me 'round again to find. I'm not the man they think, I am at home. Oh, no, no, no, and this is what I should have said. Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid. Cold, cold heart hardened by you (oh).

	Darlin'	Dante Bowe				Hey, darlin', I ain't never seen a smile like that. The way it lights up the room. You're a dream come true and it's only the beginning. And I love the way your hair curls when you let it hang below your shoulders. I thought that I should let you know that either way you're beautiful to me. And just like the sun keeps his promise to rise, I promise to love you for the rest of my life. And just like a bird hums a song in the spring, I'm captured by your symphony. Hey, darlin', just you wait and see. I think it's funny when you catch me staring at you. Well, what's a man supposed to do? But sit back and enjoy the view and think. Man, how did I get so lucky? Some people say there is no God. I know He's real 'cause we had a conversation, we made a deal. That if He lended you to me, I'd love you like His church. Sickness or health, better or worse. And just like the sun keeps his promise to rise, I promise to love you for the rest of my life. And just like a bird hums a song in the spring, I'm captured by your symphony. Hey, darlin', just you wait and see. See, see, see.	9
	Angel Para Un Final	Silvio Rodriguez				Cuentan que cuando un silencio aparecía entre dos, era que pasaba un ángel que les robaba la voz. Y hubo tal silencio el día que nos tocaba olvidar, que de tal suerte yo todavía. No terminé de callar. Todo empezó en la sorpresa, en un encuentro casual, pero la noche es traviesa. Cuando se teje el azar sin querer se hace una ofrenda. Que pacta con el dolor o pasa un ángel se hace leyenda y se convierte en amor. Ahora comprendo cuál era el ángel, que entre nosotros pasó. Era el más terrible, el implacable, el más feroz. Ahora comprendo en total este silencio mortal. Ángel que pasa besa y te abraza. Ángel para un final.
